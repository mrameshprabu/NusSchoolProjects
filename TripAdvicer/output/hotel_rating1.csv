SQ380JC,03-Mar-17,Shanghai China,4,Travel Convenience,It is indeed a very convenient choice for travellers on a longer than 12 hours of layover. Rooms are superbly appointed and well maintained. It would be ideal that with todays travellers they should incorporate power sockets at both sides of the bed for charging of muktiple devices. Other than this small comment the hotel is just perfect.

Was T,24-Feb-17,null,5,Great service and so so quiet right in the terminal,Great service clean tidy and reasonably priced given you are right there in the terminal. Although right next to the runway you cant hear a thing! Check-in a little slow but understandable as they are dealing with a lot of volume. A sumptuous breakfast - just standard.
roadtripswc,23-Feb-17,United States,5,Stayed here twice very clean and friendly customer service,this was the best airport lodging we have experienced. The hotel is very clean modern and customer service was great. We stayed here twice due to our connecting flights.

Id say its an average hotel by Singapore standards but an excellent hotel when it comes to airport hotels.Book your room in advance. The walk up rates are insane and availability can be scarce.

The hotel also sits on top...

At first we were concern about the noise because we asked for a room with a runway view but unless you are a really light sleeper the “noise” should not bother you. It feels so relaxing lazing on the bed watching the planes landing and taking off. Check-in was a breeze and we were warmly welcome at...

gsrs,16-Feb-17,usa,4,Convenient Stay At Airport,The airport offers day rooms for 6 hour stays; if you want to stay longer and do not want to go into the city the Crowne Plaza is a convenient alternative. The rooms are small but adequate; this hotel is similar to many others from the same chain

Extremely professional flexible service and a largely perfect modern room...
Bill S,13-Feb-17,null,5,Excellent hotel at the airport ,This is an ideal airport hotel you can push your luggage straight out of Changi Airport Terminal 3.

The breakfast had too many choices. Had something...
Judy8688,08-Feb-17,LondonUK,5,Great airport hotel,Airport hotels are normally soulless places with nothing attractive about them at all. The crowne plaza was a delight. Stunning rooms with White Stuff products in the bathroom. It couldnt be closer to terminal 3. Great service too from the bell boy and the check in desk. We slept wonderfully after a long flight from London.Would definitely recommend.

This time for the same price as the rooms I normally book I opted for one in the new wing. They are pokey and cheaply fitted out. The aircon is noisy and tge only window is in the bathroom.

Sharon T,16-Mar-16,Singapore Singapore,4,Comfortable airport hotel with basic amenities ,Overall the hotel stay is rather pleasant. Stayed many times and although the premier rooms overlooking the runway is the more superior ones I prefer the deluxe room cheaper and quieter. Also prefer the lower floors rather than the higher floors cos on quite a number of occasions I realised that the shower is not powerful enough and the shower...
09catlover,15-Mar-16,null,1,Awkward service and a damaged room,I stayed at the Crowne Plaza on March 14 2016 in room 643. My mother joined as well after her flight arrived.When I walked into the lobby at about nine in the evening I was not greeted and no one offered to open a door.The first thing I noticed was how hot and humid the hotel was. It...

TanjungBaraDiver,14-Mar-16,Kerobokan Indonesia,5,Great stay again,We had yet another great stay. Our flights almost always cause us to overnight in Singapore and this alternative to the transit hotels is always good. Unfortunately we cant take advantage of the breakfasts but they have a boxed option. Rooms are large and with nice views and weve been given very quiet ones lately. Bathrooms are also good services...

wayne744,13-Mar-16,Manchester United Kingdom,5,Perfect stopover hotel,Simply perfect for a stopover. It is directly connected to Terminal 3 - from stepping off the plane to entering my room took less than 20 mins. If you like watching aircraft go for a room on a high floor with a runway view. The hotel also has a great pool which is great for unwinding after a long flight.

MelbourneTravelmad,13-Mar-16,Melbourne Australia,1,Good hotel maybe; Terrible customer service definately.,I dont know whether this review will be published but it deserves to be.I made a booking at this hotel as I had a late arrival and just an overnight stop in Singapore and thought the convenience justified the extra price. (A price I add I find surprising and of levels more applicable to MBS) I made an inquiry...

Clive J,12-Mar-16,Cologne Germany,5,Day room at Changi airport singapore,We revisited the Crown Plaza hotel which is located close to the Sky train in terminal 3.

BobbyStodel,08-Mar-16,London United Kingdom,4,If you need to stay at the airport this is the right hotel,The best thing about this hotel is that you can push your trolley of luggage from the airport into the hotel entrance in Terminal Three. The room was very comfortable. The restaurant served good food. The pool was great. And in the morning we pushed our trolley out of the hotel and to our check in desk in five minutes....

jeangwee,07-Mar-16,Singapore Singapore,4,Second Staycation - but view was a shocker!,This is a late review. My family (with 2 young children) stayed at Crowne Plaza in mid-December 2015 for 3 nights.This was our second stay. We had an enjoyable stay two years ago. So we decided to book another stay with the hotel. This hotel is one of a few hotels in Singapore that offers two X Double beds...
GRW720,07-Mar-16,Boulder Colorado,3,If you MUST stay at the airport this is a good option,There are two reasons to choose to stay at the Crowne Plaza: (a) you need to be right at the airport because you have a very early flight or you are arriving so late at night that you dont want even a 25 minute taxi ride into a city hotel or (b) you have a very long connection time between...

TeOos,06-Mar-16,Singapore,4,Great place to stay for plane spotting,We stayed there for a night during the hazy period. The hotel is at Terminal 3. However all the 3 terminals are connected. Therefore it is very accessible. The room is clean and comfortable. The package comes with free breakfast. The variety are just right. We had a wonderful time and enjoyed the plane spotting view!
GerryOz,05-Mar-16,Perth,5,Best transit hotel,The hotel is land-side in Terminal 3 so one has to clear immigration to get to it and get a train from the other terminals to it (takes a minute and they arrive every 3 minutes).Perfectly silent despite being next to the control tower. Very nice rooms comfortable bed all of the usual creature comforts gowns and free wifi....
OzMaryAnn,04-Mar-16,London United Kingdom,4,Great overnight stay,After stepping off the plane from Sydney and collecting my baggage it took me all of 3 minutes to locate the entrance to the Crowne Plaza within the terminal.

Homeschooling,04-Mar-16,Madison Wisconsin,4,Last night in Singapore,If you are flying out of Singapore this hotel is a must-stay. There is no more convenient hotel at any airport.

Vigilant2013,02-Mar-16,Brackley United Kingdom,3,Very good hotel shame about the staff,This hotel is in a privileged position - no immediate competition in the location and as a result I believe the management and staff heve become complacent and unwelcoming. In the two days we have stayed here I have not seen one smile one welcoming gesture or the buzz one associates with a big hotel.The bedrooms were excellent and...
Shane B,01-Mar-16,Melbourne Australia,5,This place is the bomb,It can be expensive granted but how can you put a price on the convenience of never leaving the god damn airport?

NudeFoodDude,01-Mar-16,Yarra Valley Victoria Australia,4,Stopover Option,We stayed here as a family on our way back from KL in January. The hotel is of course very well situated for short stopovers and the service very good. The layout is more like a motel where access is via outside landings rather than air conditioned corridors. This is in part of their environment friendly approach and makes sense...

I arrived late evening and departed early morning  for...
Jgdutyfree,27-Feb-16,Fort Lauderdale Florida,3,Ok for a night. ,For an airport hotel the facilities are reasonably good. The rooms are fairly well soundproofed. They have two restaurants. A good Chinese called imperial Palace with authentic food. Great Peking duck and a broad menu. The other restaurant has a mediocre buffet. Always better to order a la Carte. Best things are the pizza and pasta offerings. They have a...
DrFletch,27-Feb-16,null,4,A good hotel when Changi airport is a convenient location,If you have to pick up luggage after your flight when you are in transit or you need a place to stay before flying early this is a very conveniently located hotel.If you only have hand luggage and you are flying in during a transit the accommodation inside the security/immigration area is much more conveniently located and better value....

Jack R,26-Feb-16,London United Kingdom,5,Perfect airport hotel for aviation enthusiast! (My most favourite hotel),A lot of people might find this hotel uncomfortable due to its location just right in front of the apron and the runway.

kissane,28-Dec-15,Perth Australia,5,Very nice,Stayed at the airport hotel (at the airlines expense) when I missed a connection. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the room breakfast and staff. Although I have come to expect everything at Changi Airport to work well I was still pleased to find that this extends to the airport hotel. No hesitation in recommending for others.
Nur A,27-Dec-15,null,5,Pleasant Stay,I booked the hotel through MOEs corporate promotion for a stay on 26 - 27 november.Reservation staff was very helpful and my request was all acceded to except for the extra bed. However it was no problem as my 10 year old moved the seats next to the window and slept soundly in it. We requested for a runway-facing...

Mookiandsam,26-Dec-15,Sydney Australia,5,Late check out at a reasonable rate,We had a night and half a day to transit flying out at 1930 and though I looked at the city hotels it was the same old dilemma. Must check out by 1100 or pay another day particularly if there are no day rooms available. We are very familiar with Singapore and did not care to wander around town. By...

You can take the MRT or a taxi into town or just stay at the hotel. Connected to Changi airport it is perfect if you have an early check in.

Linda-wanderer,24-Dec-15,Sedona Arizona,4,VERY CONVENIENT MIXED EXPERIENCE,Booked precruise and postcruise stays through Hotels.com. The prices were slightly different for a deluxe room and it was a bit confusing. We had 3 adults as shown on our reservation but there was only one bed (description had some something about a sofa which turned out to be too small for sleeping). We arrived at 1 am (had informed...

Would definitely stay again. Drinks are expensive relative to other Singapore hotels of similar class. Food at the restaurant was average. Easy access to any last minute shopping requirements.
Paul N,22-Dec-15,Short Hills New Jersey,4,Brilliant Room Design Shoddy Execution. ,The rooms are absolutely brilliantly designed though unbelievably shoddily executed: such as draws that wont stay closed because the fixtures are secured at an angle. Ditto the sliding bathroom door which once firmly closed slides open completely on its own over a few seconds. Every time.So maybe the whole floor is angled. (Room 503). Add: a bathroom light that...
NorthArrow,22-Dec-15,Philadelphia area,5,great breakfast great room can walk to it from Terminal 3,Our only complaint is the cold temperature in the room and had to learn how to adjust it. And light switches are elusive. Otherwise a very fine place. Good and free Internet is a plus as well. And the breakfast is exceptional.
LondonTell,22-Dec-15,London,1,Our stay was blighted by the IHG Booking system & staff attitude,When your paper work from the IHG booking system says A deposit of 1 night is due at the time of booking and you have booked you expect to be charged for the nights stay at the time of booking. You make a note that you have paid so four months later you dont expect to be asked to pay...
Yee L,21-Dec-15,Singapore Singapore,5,Best hotel!!!,We had a suite and I insisted on getting the one and only suite facing the runway. Although there are construction works you can still see a part of the runway which is good enough. Life is sipping afternoon tea and watching planes take off almost every moment. Fantastic experience.Room ia huge with 2 basin-bathroom walk in wardrobe living...

SilverGinger,31-Oct-15,Melbourne Australia,5,Overnighter,Stayed here for one night en route to Cambodia. The hotel is easily accessed from the airport terminals - we flew in to T2 and out of T3.Had a room on the 3rd floor which was spacious well decorated and had everything you could need for one night - probably too much! Very quiet - couldnt hear any planes....
Chris S,30-Oct-15,Jacksonville Florida,5,A WONDERFUL OASIS...,We overnighted in Singapore. The hotel is beautiful and has clean modern rooms. The reception staff was top-notch.

We also enjoyed the fact it was right at the airport.

Xavier B,18-Oct-15,null,3,A bit deceiving,You dont expect much from an airport hotel.The Crown at Singapore Changi airport is on the very high price side of transit hotels and therefore you expect something better than normal transit hotels.

ALien89,17-Oct-15,Lakeville Minnesota,4,Noisy for an airport hotel,I realize that because of the open construction of the hotel there is nothing anybody can do about the plane noise but the insulation of the windows should be better. As several reviewers have stated there is around the clock construction outside of the hotel and that is a problem at night. The friendly and helpful staff moved us to...
RoyLScam,17-Oct-15,Northern NJ,5,Best airport hotel Ive ever stayed!,This hotel would be amazing anywhere but also has the advantage of being right in the heart of Changi Airport!

I had read some not so nice reviews about this hotel but the location was too good to pass.

But connected to Singapores MRT subway system which comes to T3 where the hotel is also located and part of a large basement food court and mini-mall it is a convenient hotel even if the airport is not a factor.

This...

Zeddog,21-Mar-15,Alice Springs,3,Too expensive,I know Singapore is expensive but for even a Club Room to cost $500 per night Australian (after you add service tax and GST) is frankly ridiculous. I cant drink $100 worth of alcohol or eat that many canapés or that much breakfast to justify the cost. The bed would need to rock you to sleep or make sweet love...

Certainly a pleasant...
MaryOreally,15-Mar-15,Berlin Germany,5,Absolutely Fabulous,This was one of the best hotel experiences of my life.

Bud-dude,14-Mar-15,null,2,Its a bed...,Hmmmm....Unimpressed with Crowne Plaza... A smoking room only! Reservations for non-smoking are availability only not guaranteed. Not all that apologetic. Nice enough looking room but smells wretched on entry suitcase will have to remain closed for the night or everything will smell like a bar. I think next time Ill take my chances with the transit hotel.

William-NB,10-Jan-15,Newport Beach California,4,Very nice and very expensive,Yes the hotel is quite nice. Excellent service - smooth courteous check-in. Nicely appointed room. But do you really need to spend that much for an overnight connection? Theres not much choice and Crowne Plaza does it right. So if you have the $ to burn suck it up and pay.

Booking was easy over the internet...
Romperine,06-Jan-15,New York City New York,5,Great stay after a long flight,Singapore is my favorite hub to discover Asia.

The rooms are very contemporary and cool. Airplane noise is minimal. The only issue for some is that the hotel common areas are quite dark like a W hotel. If you hate that look youll hate the Crowne Plaza. Still the hotel is interesting in that the...

Deborah B,31-Dec-14,Orlando Florida,5,A remarkably serene property in the middle of the airport,We chose this hotel because we were arriving very late (1 a.m.) and figured we would be better off staying at the airport before going on to Sentosa.

sgmission,30-Dec-14,Singapore,4,Excellent Service,I stayed for 1 night (staycation) with family. The room was nice and spacious but too bad no view of the runway.

But the staff was polite and triedher best.The hotel is connected...
Henrik S,30-Dec-14,Stockholm,4,Great location but noisy room,Great location in the airport area. Beds comfortable but not as good as the ones you find at the Frazier. Buffet dinner was a feast.

SteenieC,26-Dec-14,Sydney Australia,4,Tremendous just a little pricy,Nothing can beat the convenience of a hotel with a ramp entrance from terminal 3. Felt like a local knowing exactly how far and where I was going when I had to leave.

Haris G,23-Dec-14,Lake Oswego Oregon,5,Excellent Location and Nice Pool,We had one night stay at this hotel before going back to the States at 7 AM. It was an awesome place to stay because they had a great pool for kids and easy to spot airplanes. It was a little bit difficult to find because of the airport construction (even for a taxi driver).

Kiwi_73_Sydney,19-Dec-14,Sydney,5,Best airport hotel in the world,Most of us conjure up a fairly grim picture when we think of having to overnight at a conveniently located hotel that really is just to sleep. What you often get is usually worse if that were possible. Especially when your hotel is a shuttle ride away which makes you think I should have just stayed somewhere I actually wanted...

FitDude,01-Dec-14,Honolulu Hawaii,5,If only all airport hotels could be this good,There are surely better airport hotels in this world but I have just never stayed at any of them yet.

Very good accessibility with a roll-in shower in the good sized restroom. Nice and helpful staff. The only minus is that the room is quite expensive.

JC505,29-Nov-14,Ennetbaden Switzerland,5,Utter Surprise,First off I have something to clarify which constitutes most of my review: I am not a chain hotel kinda person. This being said I was totally caught by surprise with this hotel. Why?

ralph r,23-May-14,Houston Texas,4,Slow check-in for an airport transit hotel frustrating,I was only staying for a four hour transit so an unreasonably slow check-in was very frustrating. Several people on line with only two desks working and after I checked in the line had doubled in length so those people were likely more irritated.

ericvietnam,10-May-14,Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam,1,good hotel...if you dont want to sleep,I stayed there on April 29th for a very short night. By definition an airport hotel is typically the kind of hotel you pick when you have very limited time between two planes. So I went to bed around midnight and ask for breakfast between 6:00 and 6:30 (the proposed choice on the breakfast menu). I filled all the boxes...
Gillian B,07-May-14,null,5,Great place to stay,We stayed here as a stopover to Europe and on return to Australia. The rooms are wonderful. Although the rooms are close to the runways the noise was minimal. The only downturn was the price of dinner at the restaurant.

SqTraveler,04-May-14,Canada,4,Best choice if you have an early morning flight!,We had an early morning flight out of Changi Airport and chose this hotel as it is connected to the airport`s Terminal 3 where our flight was departing from.

elizas,02-May-14,Melbourne Australia,5,Smoking Rooms!,This must be one of the few hotels in Singapore that offers smoking rooms. There is no balcony so this means smoking indoors.

This...

jacbinu,29-Apr-14,Pune India,4,Bit expensive,During one of my business visits to Singapore I have the privilege to stay at this hotel in the Airport premises. I must admit the facilities in the hotel are good but the location is bit far off from the city which is a distinct disadvantage unless you are in transit. The pricing was over the top when you compare...
Davwend,29-Apr-14,Adelaide Australia,3,Still good but far too expensive now,We have enjoyed staying at this hotel many times over the years as its so convenient for quick stop overs in Singapore. However we will not be doing so again as we find the pricing is now ridiculously expensive and not comparable with other hotels weve stayed at in Singapore using the same type of room facilities. We are very...

SusieatLigar,28-Apr-14,Takaka New Zealand,5,Excellent in every way-highly recommended,This is apparently rated one of the best airport hotels of the world and I can see why. One tends to forget one is a few paces from the terminals as one luxuriates in the beautiful warm pool or in the well appointed rooms. Without a doubt if you have a quick stop over in Singapore this is the place....
Dealmaker,27-Apr-14,Atlanta,4,Great Airport Hotel For Short Layover In Singapore,If you have a short layover in Singapore the Crown Plaza is the right hotel to chose.

Subrus,21-Apr-14,Bangalore,3,Well located but expensive,Coming back to this hotel after a long hiatus I expected more. But nothing really has changed. The rates remain high. Check in was rather impersonal. And you get nothing much for what you pay. The heat in the corridors is a challenge given that it is exposed to the jet fumes from the airport. Plus you get almost no...
TMcGinn_USA,20-Apr-14,New York City New York,1,Hidden Fees and Loud Noises,The sound of airplanes makes it difficult to sleep in these rooms. Also the hotel has lots of hidden fees.

Ontheblackhill,29-Mar-14,Calgary Canada,5,Great airport overnighter,We stopped here because we had an early morning flight out of Changi following a late arrival.

TerryAustralia2015,29-Mar-14,Merimbula Australia,2,Good except for beds,We stayed one night for convenience. The hotel is what youd expect for how it is advertised.After spending time travelling it is fantastic to walk straight into a hotel without leaving the airport.There was one major thing that spoiled our otherwise quite good stay. The bed was on the hard side of firm. It was very hard in...

Lee78AUS,27-Mar-14,Sydney Australia,4,Very nice stay and location,Stopped here with an 11 hour transit between Sydney and London. Very easy to access from the arrivals terminal at Changi. Even though it is a little pricey its well well worth it when wanting breaking up the long flight between Australia and UK. Staff were very friendly and the rooms are huge (and very clean). Would highly recommend.
storm t,25-Mar-14,Bandar Seri Begawan Brunei Darussalam,3,Modern Room,The direction of the hotel is missing if you go from Terminal 2. There is no proper indication where the hotel is situated. Since Ive stayed in the hotel before I managed to locate the hotel based on memory. The management of the hotel should make an effort to have some sort of direction / indication so patrons will not...

Compared to hotel down town...
Annique D,22-Mar-14,Atlanta Georgia,5,The perfect airport hotel,I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport my last two nights in Singapore. Was really conveniently located to the airport literally connected to terminal 3.

Leigh C,22-Mar-14,Melbourne Australia,4,disappointed with breakfast.,We had an overnight stay in Singapore due to lateness of flight.

JHYYZ,21-Mar-14,Toronto Canada,5,Great Airport Hotel,We had a one night stay with four children. The hotel is perfect for what it is. Beautifully appointed good service super quiet even though right by the runway. The restaurant is good. The one criticism would be the very slow check in. It seems to be a Singapore thing but this was particularly bad a long line and two...
wolfman50,21-Mar-14,Israel,5,Perfect,Need I say more than this is exactly the way an airport hotel should be. After a long flight this is an oasis of rejuvenating calm and comfort.

We used the hotel restaurants and bars and truly appreciated the luxury of spending the hours here...
Banno88,17-Mar-14,null,5,Comfortable stop over,The Crowne Plaza at Changai International Airport is spot on for a one night stop over assuming you arrive late and have a flight to catch the next day (Im not sure why youd stay there otherwise!). We arrived into T3 at 7pm and had a flight the following morning. Following a 14 hour flight the easy access to the...

Kathy G,08-Mar-14,Seattle Washington United States,5,Great Hotel for early morning flight,I had an early morning flight out of Changi Airport after I returned to Singapore after an Asian cruise. The hotel is part of the airport. Changi airport has three terminals and you just walk down the hall in the hotel to your terminal or take the sky train. What could be easier and no taxis to worry about.My...
Mario S,07-Mar-14,Toronto Canada,4,The best hotel for layover,Simply and without a doubt the best hotel for layover if your company paying. When I say when your company paying is because I think this property is a overpriced their rate.

Cyba,03-Mar-14,London,5,Very convenient great rooms,I always try to stay here when Im on an overnight transit in Singapore.

Steve H,27-Feb-14,Oakland California,5,Super Convenient Stunningly Modern Airport Hotel,First the Changi Crowne Plaza is steps away from baggage claim making it THE choice for weary cross-Pacific travelers to get some much-needed rest after dozens of hours of travel.

RickShoemaker,27-Feb-14,Vero Beach Florida,4,SIN Crowne Plaza Airport,Was a nice stay.. I was mis informed as to the location of the hotel to the Delta gates..Delta is on the other side of the airport and the tram does not operate in time for deltas first flight..I was lucky that a cabbie stopped illegally to pick me up.

KeKu1999,14-Feb-14,Brisbane Australia,4,Pleasant space for extended transit stay!,Although a little pricey (SGD160++) for day rest (1100-1900hrs) it was money well spent given that we flew in on Air Asia which doesnt allow through connection of baggage to another airline (most full service airlines can do this) so we had to clear customs/immigration and wait 12hrs for our next flight! Easy access upon stepping off terminal 3 airtrain....

F1gar0,11-Jan-14,Wellington New Zealand,4,Perfect for the long transit,We wanted to make the most of the our stop-over in Singapore (over 24 hours) and although many some airlines have tie-ins with hotels in town we wanted a place that we could crash as soon as we arrived Changi.

GlobeJump,01-Jan-14,Sydney Australia,5,Great for stopover,Very convenient quiet and clean. Booked it to relax between flights and thats what I got. Wouldnt upgrade for club access the next time as I didnt find it worth the money paid. What i found odd was the booking said that breakfast was included however as a day use room the permitted check in time was after breakfast hours...
Helen S,01-Jan-14,Singapore Singapore,4,Pricey pretty hotel with good service though improvements can be made,Visited for a staycation for 3 nights over the Christmas holidays. The Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport is very very much better than most airport hotels. Its 4-star if Im not mistaken - and the facilities and rooms bear up to that standard.

JasoninNewtown,25-Dec-13,Sydney Australia,5,Perfect for a rest at Singapore Airport.,This is my second stay here and like the first I think it would undoubtedly be the best place to rest if youve got a short overnight stop in Singapore to deal with. Its nicely designed with a softly lit interior (i.e. dark) and plush rooms. Breakfast is very nice - can recommend the congee.
pillowsofwanderlust,23-Dec-13,Los Angeles CA,4,Not your average airport hotel or your average airport,We stayed here for our last night in Singapore since our flight home left quite early. The hotel is directly connected to Terminal 3 very convenient. The hotel has a unique design far from your average airport hotel.

harinibrk,22-Dec-13,San Francisco California,4,Very convenient Hotel,This hotel is well connected to the airport and is very convenient for early morning flights from the airport. They also pack breakfast if you want to when you have an early flight. The rooms and bathrooms are large. The one thing I found again this time was they did not have razor and shaving cream again in the room.
Barbara W,21-Dec-13,Utah,4,Convenient and very clean but only for airline connections.,I stayed here twice for a total of three nights. The major advantage and it is obvious is that this hotel is right in the airport. The room was immaculate. It is also convenient for accessing the MTR rail into town. That said there are some drawbacks. Although my room overlooked a runway the noise of airplanes taking off was...
Biogeog,21-Dec-13,Calgary Canada,5,Great for a quick stay,We spent one night here. It couldnt be more convenient to the airport. The train to the city was about 30 minutes. The rooms were fantastic with great beds nice shower and quite large (we had a deluxe double room) easily big enough for two adults and two kids. The pool was fantastic too. Highly recommended for a quick layover.
Andrew D,21-Dec-13,Yulara Australia,5,Absolutely awesome,First time here and we will definitely stay here again. We travel overseas quite a bit with 2 small kids (soon to be teenagers) and this place was a really good option.

MumbaiIndiTraveller,18-Dec-13,Mumbai,3,Nice rooms but unpleasant staff,We checked in at 1am after missing a flight connection. Being with my folks on a wheel chair and my two small kids tired on a pram the hotel did NOTHING to be courteous. Despite being first in line our documents were set aside and other guests were attended to first. Our check in was handled by a Ms. Elaine...
bluebiker,17-Dec-13,Auckland Region New Zealand,4,A no hassle option,We have been transiting Singapore off on and on for a awhile now and have tended to stay in the CBD.

KittyExplorers,13-Dec-13,null,4,Gotta try a stay just for the experience!,Crowne Plaza was a little treat for us after we landed shortly & although we made a walk-in reservation we were given a very comfortable & quiet room on the 8th floor; one of their Club floors.We were very grateful that ours wasnt facing the runway as we have a toddler but still could view planes taking off &...
ECURBLEBO1,12-Dec-13,Newark Delaware,4,Great location,Great location right in the airport I didnt even have to take my bags off of the cart. It is a bit pricy but you are paying for location The big problem was the water for the shower was not real hot. After flying all day I really needed a hot shower.

Irov1,11-Dec-13,null,2,Not worthy of five stars!,Where to start; the staff were not too friendly at check in. It costs to use the internet or you can go into the airport or local bars and get it for free. We had an early start of 3.00am which they knew about but where did they put us? Only next to the runway where we heard every flipping...

DanSS74,10-Dec-13,Sydney Australia,5,Excellent,Stayed here to break up the long flight from Sydney to London. Couldnt have asked for any more.

derekang1980,09-Dec-13,Singapore,4,Excellent airport hotel!,Crowne Plaza may be ranked number 5 in the world but honestly the design and maintenance deserves much much more.Well-designed and boasts a beautiful facade as well as maintenance is almost top-notch!

David W,05-Dec-13,London United Kingdom,3,My second visit - this time not so impressed,Having spent almost £200 for a family room for four I made the mistake of thinking that breakfast was included as it was on my first visit. It was not and I was asked to pay an additional 130 SD (£65) which I refused for a simple meal. Instead I checked out early and had breakfast at T3 Food Court...

joleneacox,01-Dec-13,Canberra Australia,2,Convenient,We had a stopover in Singapore for just a night so we booked this hotel. It was quite expensive however the room given was great- very clean and comfortable. The downside is that it was weird looking out of the window and all you see is planes coming in and out. Also for the price you have to pay you...
Diving-Addiction00,01-Dec-13,Singapore Singapore,5,Best Airport Hotel in South East Asia,By far the number one airport hotel in South East Asia.

Peachhat,01-Dec-13,New York City New York,4,Best hotel for quick stopover in SG,My husband and I had an overnight layover in SG and decided to stay here. It was quite expensive but we decided to stay here over going back into the city as the amenities (gym pool etc.) looked great and were exactly what we needed at our fingertips at the end of a three week trip. There was some confusion...
MarkP4,28-Nov-13,Adelaide Australia,4,Convenient but a little weird,A very early flight out of Changi made the Crowne Plaza a convenient choice rather than head to a hotel in the CBD. Getting to the hotel is easy with a direct connection to T3 on both the arrivals and departure levels (reception is on the arrivals level). I wasnt expecting the corridors to be open to the outside so...
JoelNili,27-Nov-13,Boca Raton Florida,5,Excellent Hotel,The Crown Plaza Hotel at Changi Airport is a luxorious property that will please the most discriminating travelers.

commabys,27-Nov-13,Hong Kong China,5,Comfort Stay,Crowne Plaza Changi is located right next to T3 of Changi Airport which there are a lot dining options available. If you want to go to downtown its around 30mins away by taxi and cost around S$20 to $30 depending on your destination and travel time.I would say this hotel is very good in most of the aspects. Actually...

PamNord,23-Nov-13,Adelaide Australia,4,Extremely convenient for overnight stop fantastic soundproofing,My family and I (2 adults and 1 toddler) found the Crowne Plaza to be extremely convenient (though expensive) for a recent overnight stop in Singapore due to its location in Terminal 3 of Changi Airport.

TinyThots,22-Nov-13,Orlando,3,Nice Hotel but Grossly Overpriced,Likes:Location if you want to be at the airport (terminal 3). Rooms are nice.Dislikes:Front desk is ALWAYS understaffed. Corridors are not enclosed and cooled so its pretty hot n humid outside the room. TV is too far from bed head. Even TV remote had trouble communicating with TV. Price - almost the same as what you would...
Anders A,21-Nov-13,Saint-Chinian France,4,Convenient to Changi but expensive and no free WiFi,Very nice comfortable hotel right at Changi airport. Convenient for over-night stops when you dont want to use the in-terminal hotels.Crowne Plaza is MUCH more expensive though and does NOT offer free/included WiFi which should be standard in this class of hotel in 2013!
David P,21-Nov-13,Auckland Region New Zealand,5,An Oasis in a sea of Chaos,Traveling from New Zealand to Osaka Japan we chose a one night stay in Singapore to break the travel into 2 legs. Changi International airport is a world of chaos people and cultures. The Crowne Plaza is an exceptional experience for the weary traveller located in one of the airports 3 terminals.The rooms are stylish well appointed and above...
frequentstaydude,20-Nov-13,San Diego California,4,Mixed feelings but mostly from a Platinum members expectations,Certainly a nice hotel.As the inconsistent Crowne Plaza brand goes globally one of the better brand standards for the brand anywhere.Front desk staff was reasonably efficient but robotic and not very welcoming or hospitable.To access your room you have to walk through outdoor corridors. It was raining during my stay. Between the humidity and the rain the...
ClarkePhillips,20-Nov-13,Brisbane Australia,5,Jetlag Haven,This was our first time flying in many years and not realizing planes are un-sleepable torture machines I booked midnight flights.

William A,19-Nov-13,Maidstone United Kingdom,4,Location is everything,I stay here whenever in transit through Singapore and bar one slip up they are consistent in cleanliness efficiency and hospitality. However the price varies which is no surprise I suppose with how far in advance one books etc. If you can book well in advnace then do so. The MTR into the city is alright taxis can be quicker...

retinadoc52,14-Nov-13,Jakarta Indonesia,3,Only good for its location,Convenient location if you on an extended transit.Front desk person was quite incompetent. Got my last name wrong despite having my passport infront of him so I could not sign up for internet. After complaining it still was not changed. So finally I gave the wrong name they said I had been registered under.Hotel is clean enough and...

noelandmaxine,13-Nov-13,Gold Coast,5,Plane spotters paradise,Located in Terminal Three but with access to the other terminals via the Skytrain. Accepted the offer of a room overlooking the runway on the 9th floor. Some noise but not invasive. Large tastefully decorated room with big windows. One of the most comfortable hotel beds we have slept in for a long time. Very nice pool in a tropical...
Spamsushi,12-Nov-13,Oregon,4,A Pleasant Stay..,This hotel is ideally located especially for travelers with early flights out of Changi. Its located right at the airport. Changi airport is one of the nicest airport we have ever seen and the hotel opens right into the airport terminal so regardless of your flight time its very convenient. We stayed in a Chinatown hotel for one night and...
applecart3355,11-Nov-13,Jakarta Indonesia,4,Savvy hotel best experienced with IHG membership,This hotel has a very dark ambience on its exterior hallways lounges. While it can be off-putting to some it suited us well because we were leaving at early in the morning (5AM). I believe such ambience will suit jet-lagged people as well.It also has eco design. Hallways is open-air to cut air conditioning bills etc. We find it...
robert_bos53,10-Nov-13,Geneva Switzerland,5,A must for plane spotters and fans of Changi,For an overnight transfer walk out of the luxury of Changi Terminal 3 into the luxury of Crown Plaza. Not your ordinary airport hotel I was fortunate to get an Platinum Ambassador upgrade to a corner suite overlooking terminals 1 and 3. Noise levels were at a minimum (not zero obviously) with the great spectacle of A380s coming and going...
LeonieshorncliffeQLD,08-Nov-13,Brisbane Australia,3,Not as good as expected,Based on other reviews i expected this hotel to be something special as an airport stopover choice. Firstly there was no signage and i had to ask someone where it was located. I arrived through what looked like the main entrance to the hotel in the airport concourse and walked past the restaurant to find escalators. There was no sign...
Mahjarunner,07-Nov-13,Denver Colorado,3,Convenience factor is high but value is low,We stayed here on our last night in Singapore because we had to be at the airport at 5am. The location cannot be beat for international travelers as its part of Terminal 3. The hotel bills itself as 5 star but Id give it 3.5-4 stars. Its very nice but there were just too many minuses for me. The lobby...

grantravels,04-Nov-13,Oxfordshire,4,Excellent Stopover,We stayed here on our way through Singapore to Borneo. This hotel just fitted the bill.

Mas Illazreen G,03-Nov-13,Shah Alam Malaysia,2,Just for transitNo way 5star,I arrived at midnight after a long flight. the concierge was located inside the lobby and nobody to assist my luggage upon arrival at the entrance after the taxi dropped me. I had to leave the luggage outside to find the concierge.To make it worse checkin was very very slow. The room was just average. The hair dyer was out...
Nodutchdolly,02-Nov-13,Milton Keynes,4,Great place to break a long journey,If you have a long flight from Europe to Australia the Crowne Plaza is an ideal place to rest up for one or two nights.

GerryOz,02-Nov-13,Perth,5,Best transit hotel,After a missed connection QANTAS sent us to the Crown Plaza overnight.It is land-side so one needs to clear immigration. Very fast though.There is an airside hotel too (ambassador) but that is not so good.Great place nice rooms comfortable amazingly quiet huge pool.Why are all hotel airports this good (or for that matter why not hotels...
Andrew R,02-Nov-13,Mt Barker South Australia,4,Only for one night.,Would recommend only if staying overnight to connect to another flight. If stying longer consider downtown.

TanjungBaraDiver,31-Oct-13,Kerobokan Indonesia,3,OK but some issues with noise,I usually stay here when on business or while in transit. Its very convenient to the airport of course and previously Ive never noticed the noise but this time my door was facing the airport and the sky trains and it seems to funnel noise into the room. The view is OK (over the pool) but hard for me to...

packedandready2go,28-Oct-13,California,4,Well located adjacent to Changing Airport terminal 3,I have had to change planes in Changi Airport on many occasions. If my transfer time is long enough to require a hotel but not overly long I highly recommend the Ambassador Transit Hotels which are located within the airport so one doesnt have to go through customs. However the rooms are small and basic. This time I had 12...
The_TRH_Website,27-Oct-13,Singapore,5,4-5 star hotel with 5.5 star overall package,I suspect Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Singapore was designed by a Virgo.I have never had a good impression of airport hotels. I have always thought of them as necessary but uninteresting and utilitarian affairs kind of … like toilets. As airports are usually quite far away from city centres I cannot quite fathom anyone using an airport hotel as...
SriniSRA,26-Oct-13,Mumbai (Bombay) India,4,Comfortable; Great location for short business trips,The location is an advantage and a disadvantage. The hotel is in the terminal 3 building so getting there is a matter of minutes. You can be in your hotel room within 20-30 mins of the aircraft landing.

Max M,24-Oct-13,Sydney Australia,4,Very nice hotel but comes with the price tag,So I made a mistake in organizing my connecting flight and was stranded in Changi airport (outside the secure area) waiting for my flight out six hours later.Good thing the Crowne Plaza had a room available and I must say that it was one of the better hotel rooms Ive ever stayed in. All the amenities were there -...

TopGun666,22-Oct-13,null,4,Great Overnight Stay,With a 17 hour stop over in Singapore I was initially hesitant about booking an IHG branded hotel after a horrendous stay at the Crowne Plaza Times Square (New York). The Crowne Plaza Times Square would rate in my humble opinion as the most arrogant bunch of misfits trying to run a hotel.Well what a surprise the Crowne Plaza...
Greg2951,22-Oct-13,Carlsbad California,5,Comfortable Singapore Stopover,I have had the opportunity to stop over at the Crowne Plaza at the Changi Singapore airport on several occassions.

Read on to find out if I would do it again.From Arrivals in...
Jane R,20-Oct-13,London United Kingdom,3,Ok for a stopover,Fine as a airport stop over with no time to vist Singapore but very expensive ands rather soulless. Rooms modern and clean with excellent bathrooms. Dinner disappointing - many of the buffet dishes were either cool or empty - with a small glass of the least expensive wine costing $16.
JSLUMA,20-Oct-13,Bozeman Montana,4,Ease and Comfort,Very nice hotel. Great for an overnight at the airport if youre arriving late or just need a place to rest for a day in between flights. Easy to get to - just take the tram to terminal 3 and its right around the corner from where you get off.

sparoz,18-Oct-13,Sippy Downs Australia,5,Great airport hotel,Just an overnight stay here but I am continue to be impress with the Crowne Plaza consistency.

DeeKayAdelaide,17-Oct-13,Adelaide,5,Excellent airport hotel - one of the best,I have stayed in many airport hotels over the years and this is one of the best.

I love...
Fred W,06-Oct-13,San Francisco California,2,SO mediocre SO frustrating in SO many ways except location,The location of this property is distinctive an easy walk from all terminals. The sound insulation seems to be quite good Singapore has planes arriving and departing at all hours and you cannot hear them. And that is where the benefits stop. This is a dark and confusing property that is over priced and has little attention to so many...
jovan v,04-Oct-13,Cape May New Jersey,3,good but overpriced,had to stay here during transit to Holland the hotel is nice friendly staff and convenience. Food was standard and the room size was on the low side with good amenities though. I think it is overpriced for the value that it offer it is basically a small hotel with luxury decor.

JetsForFunJourneys,01-Oct-13,Milwaukee Wisconsin,4,Second Stay,Consistent with the other stays. Convenient location is perfect for those early morning flights. The nightly rate is definitely a premium especially since no free internet. The internet is S$9 for 24 hours.The big negative is that the airport train does not run during the late night so you are stuck taking the airport bus from door #8 to...
PhilthetravellerXI,30-Sep-13,Sydney,3,Convenient and nice accommodation,This new hotel is so well located at the northern end of terminal 3 at Changi Airport in Singapore.

No really a problem...

Sam S,28-Sep-13,null,4,Overnight with kids,I have stayed a few times by myself for work and always found the CP at Changi to more than meet requirements.With two small kids (4 & 2) it didnt disappoint. The concierge was extremely helpful and efficient with the luggage.

Bunehop,27-Sep-13,Sydney,4,Great hotel but the bar prices..,Very convenient to terminal 3 with direct access other terminals require skyrail connection although you can walk from terminal but it is fair way with luggage.

Its convenient...
Tnuh,19-Sep-13,Adelaide Australia,4,Location is what it is all about.,Position is all what this hotel is about.

nana963,17-Sep-13,Kuala Lumpur Malaysia,5,5 star!,Ive just made a right decision to choose this hotel. We were given a room on 8th floor and facing the airport runway.

Simply excellent hotel with beyond outstanding service....
Belle06,17-Sep-13,London,3,Excellent airport hotel-shame about the Wifi,This is one of the best airport hotels for business travel in all respects except for the wifi. Internet in the rooms only via the desk cable is disappointing if you want to relax and work on the sofa. Im a Mac user and didnt have an adaptor so had to face working on roaming. Sub optimal. Please sort this...
mon82,16-Sep-13,Atlanta,5,Tops airport hotels around the world!,This hotel tops any airport hotel. It reminded me of staying at a Shangri-La. The staff the service the rooms - everything was outstanding and exceptional. The hotel is within the airport terminal but what airport terminal is that?! Its a mall - with no exaggeration.

Shah_Rukh_2007,14-Sep-13,Montreal Canada,3,Exceptional location ... good service ... ordinary rooms,The most amazing thing about this hotel is its location - right off terminal 3 at Singapore airport. You dont even have to take a shuttle; just walk right in from the terminal. The location also means that guests have access to a cornucopia of shops and restaurants at the airport - another huge advantage of its location.The service...
Onthewalkway,14-Sep-13,Bangkok,2,Crown Plaza not at its best,Had to stay over night at Changi although not a particular friend of airport hotels. Check in very busy even at 1 am. Nice rooms but noisy due to exposure to two sides: windows and door to the outside walkway. Aircon blows even at lowest level directly to the bed. Changi Airport is almost perfect the airport hotel is not!

Judi S,10-Sep-13,Mississauga Canada,4,Great Hotel - easy access to go downtown,We stayed at the Crown Plaza following a cruise. We liked that it was connected to the new airport but yet it felt very separate. We did not notice any airplane noise. The room was nicely laid out and had great amenities. There is a huge glass window over the tub which looks into the room with blinds that go...
MalDann,09-Sep-13,Perth Australia,4,Very convenient,Staying at the Crowne Plaza is very convenient for air travellers as it borders Changi airport. The rooms are very clean the service very good and the bath was excellent to soak in after a long days travelling/working.

LuckyLooch,03-Sep-13,London UK,2,Fantastic hotel let down by very poor booking experience,Hotel chosen out of necessity due to late arrival into Singapore early morning departure and the Transit hotel being full. That said I had wanted to try this hotel ever since it was built.I travelled with my family 2 adults + 3 children. I am continuously dumbfounded by many hotels inability to understand the requirements of families of 5...

All the transit hotels were booked up and as we had our 6 month old son with us we needed somewhere other than...
pixie0427,31-Aug-13,New Delhi India,4,Convenience comfort class,I am not particularly into airport hotels. Usually my preference when transiting through Changi Airport Singapore is the transit hotel within the transfer area. This time though I had a longish overnight stopover. Electing to stay at the Crowne Plaza turned out to be an excellent decision.Instead of aircraft one woke up to the sound of birds in the...
Jensens_Rock,30-Aug-13,Sydney,5,Great place for a stop over to Europe,Stopped over here for two nights on our way to Europe. This was a great hotel an the ease of walking off the plane into the hotel and the reverse as we left was fantastic.

RZN1,29-Aug-13,null,4,Short Trip,Spent a night in the King Bed Premier Room. The rate is reasonable for a hotel that basically in the airport as itself. For premier the room is quite small since it is an airport hotel and we are staying for a night its not a problem.Near to many amenities. Since the hotel is in terminal 3 there are...

Murray L,26-Aug-13,Christchurch New Zealand,5,Just the tops,From the moment we checked in up to the moment we checked out this was a hotel that made us feel at home. The staff were efficient and friendly and prepared to go out of their way to help. The room was on the ninth floor which was accessed quickly through oh-so-smooth lifts and was spotlessly clean. Very comfortable and...

BillM1964,25-Aug-13,Jakarta,2,1970s Hotel,Would you believe in 2013 in Singapore there exists a hotel that claims to be the worlds best airport hotel that does not have WIFI?Really. I know it sounds beyond belief as WIFI is available just about everywhere in Singapore - and the world for that matter - but not in the rooms of the worlds best airport hotel....

Mark D,23-Aug-13,Canterbury United Kingdom,3,OK but not great,Two overnight stays in a week and needless to say after various flights a good nights sleep is the main requirement. The first night was OK but the second a few days later was spoilt by being put in a smoking room having specicifically booked a non-smoking room. Unfortunately when you arrive late due to flight delays no choices are...
johnmce1984,22-Aug-13,Brighton,4,Great modern hotel for an overnight stay,We had a premier double room for an overnight stopover before flying out to Bali the next morning.Arrived late so we only spent a few hours here but its definitely one of the best airport hotels Ive stayed in. Obviously its the location which makes the place (Entrance inside the terminal building) but it doesnt seem to rely on...
David W,20-Aug-13,London United Kingdom,5,Fabulous in Transit Overnight Stay,Fabulous Hotel just past Immigration Exit Hall. Not cheap but well worth paying for on a room and breakfast deal if you are in Transit and the Ambassador Transit Hotels are full.

Fiona M,18-Aug-13,Auckland Region New Zealand,4,Welcome rest on long journey,Wonderful well appointed room great room service and a lovely rest on a long journey. Much better than staying at the transit hotel and worth it even if you are staying only 12 hours for a great rest. Easy to find from the terminal. Quiet hotel and a quick check in! Unbelievable in an airport hotel.

Flitness,14-Aug-13,Canberra Australia,4,Lovely just two small problems,There was nothing more awesome than getting out of customs and finding yourself in your hotel in a manner of minutes. Especially at 10:30pm after a flight from Sydney. The staff were wonderful made it a breezy process and the room was spacious and best of all the shower was perfect. My partner and I stayed for two nights. The...
John P,14-Aug-13,null,3,Best or Meanest?,By any standards the Crowne Plaza at Changi airport is a quality hotel. Compared to the average airport hotel it stands out as one of the best I have known. Access is a few minutes’ walk from T3 all connected with no need to go outdoors. The hotel building is beautifully designed to make maximum use of local flora. Rooms...

The beauty of...

But the airport just a walk away has free...
coastr,10-Aug-13,London United Kingdom,4,Good Stopover Hotel,Weve stayed three times and all have been very good. A great long-haul stop-over option if you want some rest a shower and a lounge by a pool before getting on your next flight.

This hotel is great...
nandlwall,08-Aug-13,Llantrisant United Kingdom,5,Excellent stay,We thoroughly enjoyed our two 1-night stop-overs at this hotel. Its adjacent to the airport so once youre through customs its just 10 minutes before youre in your room. The rooms are very comfortable. Theres a good pool and the staff are ultra attentive. We have no hesitation in recommending. One small thing that could improve is the provision of...
TJ N,05-Aug-13,null,5,A wonderful hotel,We have stayed here twice and loved it both times. A five star hotel with all of the comforts and services you would expect. And the outdoor pool is simply heaven after a hot day in Singapore! One minor point the days of charging for wifi (especially in somewhere like Singapore) need to stop!
Paul V,04-Aug-13,Perth,5,Nice Rest before flight home,We had a day / overnight stay before our flight back to Perth. Nice and convenient location right next to the monorail to out departing terminal which was great because we had quite a bit of luggage. Nice and friendly staff at the reception and restaurant.

Aglaure,01-Aug-13,Park City Utah,5,Luxurious and convenient,Our family of 6 recently stayed in 2 rooms at this lovely hotel. In fact we have stayed here on numerous occasions before an early morning flight back home so it has kind of become a mandatory part of any trip to Asia. The king rooms are more like suites with a separate living room and extra bathroom and the...
annakatrine,31-Jul-13,Pretoria South Africa,4,5 Star Hotel - why charge for internet?,We had a hiccup with Vietnam visas so needed 24 hours extra in Singapore so it seemed sensible to just book into the hotel which is next to T3.

smbsstt,29-Jul-13,Melbourne Australia,5,Fantastic Transit Hotel,We stopped here for one night before our early flight home. The hotel is very close to T3 and easily accessible from anywhere in the airport. The hotel itself is very modern and has some really cool and quirky hallways and room features. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were large and spacious. Definitely the top pick when...
daleuark74,28-Jul-13,Fayetteville Arkansas,3,Convenience at a cost,A strange series of dark zigzagging entryways from T3 and yet another escalator will eventually land you at the registration desk with nice enough staff. Hallways to rooms are outdoors but within the core rather than around the perimeter so its fine. Rooms also - fine. A rather loud flowers theme and one of those trendy all glass bathrooms with...
THOMAS H,27-Jul-13,MESA,5,Perfect Location for International Travelers,This was our second trip to Singapore and just like our first one 30 years ago everything worked with precision and smoothness!

Alice_Steve_B,26-Jul-13,Perth Australia,4,Good stopover/transit hotel but for a quiet nights sleep...,... ask for a room facing away from the runway. We assumed that being a hotel right on the runways that it would be triple glazed/insulated from the noise but we still heard loud airplane take-off noise all night in our room facing the runway. Since we had a 6 month old baby with us Im not sure why hotel...

That its located in the terminal is...

gilwhoever,23-Jul-13,Bangkok Thailand,5,Good to be in transit,This is not the place one would stay to visit Singapore but as stop over between two flights yes. We spent only one night arriving in the evening and catching another flight early morning. The hotel is easily accessible from all terminals. We arrived at T3 to depart from T2. Can catch the shuttle monorail from the 2nd floor. Breakfast...
Margot G,23-Jul-13,Nelson New Zealand,5,Excellent Hotel,We have stayed at this hotel twice now and found it excellent on both occasions. The second time we brought friends with us and they were also very impressed. We find the trip into Singapore city is a breeze on the MRT and at $2.10 to Orchard it doesnt break the bank. The rooms are well presented and clean the...
Rishen,22-Jul-13,Brisbane,4,Perfect airport hotel,Stay here about 8-10 times a year when transiting through Changi & cannot recommend the hotel highly enough. If you are in Changi for less than 24hours this hotel is perfect. Located at T3 Changi its an oasis away from the business of the airport. Windows must either be double / triple glazed as you can hardly hear the rumble...
Philippe A,22-Jul-13,France,3,Very expensive hotel for the services offered,On the top of about 175 € for the room and breakfast  I had to pay more than 20 € for a limited 24 hours internet bill : this is not acceptable for such an hotel class !!! Im used to go to Changi village hotel about 2.5 km away  for 50 € less you get the same...
CAL31M,21-Jul-13,Malibu California,4,Comfortable and convenient,The Crowne Plaza can be accessed from inside the terminal. Unlike the transit hotels inside the airport you do have to go through immigration to get there but we found that process to be pretty quick and easy (unlike some airports). The hotel has modern decor and is nicely decorated. The only thing that some people may not like is...

Harrison-act,20-Jul-13,Canberra Australia,5,overnight stay between flights,very nice high quality hotel at the airport. You do have to go out through immigration to get to the hotel however in typical singapore style this is a very efficient and quick process.

Rather than pushing on through to Australia we stayed overnight here.Yes its expensive I guess but the chance to stop and shower/bath eat and change your clothes put us in a better situation the day after than just charging through and crashing when we arrived home.The hotel...
sundinkc,18-Jul-13,Brooklyn New York,5,Great airport hotel cool design,I stayed here during a layover at Changi Airport.As the hotel is attached to Terminal 3 and I arrived in Terminal 2 I had to ask for directions and take the people mover.

Grace W,18-Jul-13,Mountainside New Jersey,4,Great Airport Hotel,We booked this hotel mainly because we didnt want to miss the early flight. It was pretty expensive for a night but we didnt expect much from an Airport Hotel therefore we checked in late so that we could do more sightseeing during the last day of our stay in Singapore. It was a big mistake! Just like what other...

NeeShen,17-Jul-13,Penang Island Malaysia,5,Luxurious but noisy transit hotel,The luxury of the hotel starts with the dimly lit lobby and a very efficient check-in. My bags were taken the the room as I leave the hotel to spend some time in town right after check-in. You would have better luck walking to the Terminal 3 a few steps away to get on the taxi as the hotel is...

Kat H,15-Jul-13,San Marcos Texas United States,5,Fantastic Base for a 24 hour layover,The mere convenience of stepping out of a long flight and being able to walk to your hotel right outside your terminal is a huge factor in what makes this hotel an excellent stay. It was really easy to find and the moment you walk through the entrance bridge I was struck by how tranquil and elegant the atmosphere was--...

Trentbro,13-Jul-13,Wollongong Australia,4,Nice room in convenient location,After a quick check-in we found our room was spacious and with large windows providing lots of natural light and views over the airport (including the runway). This last point is a consideration for light sleepers as several times during the night I was disturbed by planes taking off.The room was well laid out with a bath work desk...
Pipaya,13-Jul-13,Sydney Australia,4,Very convenient!!,Great stop over hotel couldnt be closer to the airport! So easy!! Rooms are great perfect size and we only had a deluxe room. They should include Internet! Friendly staff and wed stay again for sure!

We had 18 hours to spend in Singapore and rather than our usual heading off to the city and doing something extravagant we decided to just sit by the pool. Great decision. The accommodation was as expected for this rating of hotel staff were polite and helpful....
Elizabeth H,12-Jul-13,Brisbane Australia,3,Never fails to disappoint,Again I stayed here due to an overnight gap between flights and the only thing that can be said in its favour is that it is conveniently situated for a transit stop. Its expensive and the rooms are spacious and clean but getting a bit jaded now. As usual the service is disinterested and so-so. The thing that really irks...
RachelNT,11-Jul-13,Willunga Australia,4,Best in-room dining ever,Stayed at Crowne Plaza whilst in transit to Langkawi. I would recommend staying here to anyone but it does come at a price.

So for service comfort and convenience -...

The hotel is well placed for all three terminals and easy to get to using the SIN airport terminal transit rail system.

africantraveler1,10-Jul-13,Washington DC District of Columbia,3,No wireless? Come on...,I stayed at this hotel because of the convenience of being in the hotel Terminal and in that respect you cant beat it. From door of plane to hotel room took about 25mins which is great.BUT there is no wireless internet in the rooms!!! I cant imagine how one can justify this in 2013. I have stayed in the...
Jasonwm,10-Jul-13,Dallas Texas,1,Horrible- Not a 5 star hotel!,The rooms at this hotel are not maintained well at all. We switched rooms after we were placed in a room that had buckling wallpaper a broken desk furniture that was torn. The beds at this hotel are extremely hard and uncomfortable. It felt like we were sleeping on the floor- even after the manager had housekeeping add two additional...
Bond007123,09-Jul-13,null,4,One step away from terminal 3,There are cheaper hotels no doubt but I couldnt be bothered with the hassle of finding one and then getting a taxi. Take my advice in the airport stay here. I didnt have a reservation. No problem. The rooms are extremely well appointed and you have great views of the airport action. Good sound proofing makes that action less than...
Octovianus G,09-Jul-13,Jakarta Jakarta Raya Indonesia,4,Right hotel in Singapore when needs to fly early in the morning,Modern hotel just right in Changi Airport area. Just the right hotel in Singapore when you need to fly away very early in the morning & dont need to go the city center.

MjMarlay,08-Jul-13,Kuwait,2,No customer service lack of management follow-up,The hotel design and location are great as are the rooms. Very comfortable and it could be a great hotel with just a little effort...but sadly other than Pen in the Club Lounge none of the staff made any effort to give any service or even to recognize their customers.Management seems to be a challenge at the Crowne Plaza...
Markus B,07-Jul-13,Altenstadt Germany,4,A great place for a stop over night in Singapur,I had to stay in Singapur for one night (because of ticket preference etc...). After some research I ended up booking a room at this hotel. The hotel itself is in the airport and you can walk straight from the arrival terminal to the check in counter.

Siddy W,04-Jul-13,Auckland Region New Zealand,4,great stopover hotel,this is the best hotel for transit in singapore especially on your connecting flight. Its just about 5 minutes walk from the arrival lounge. The only drawback is that the price is too high i guess its because of its location. Overall the hotel is very good.
XmasKid,02-Jul-13,Auckland Region New Zealand,4,Great stopover beds,We paid the Crowne Plaza at Changi Airport a flying visit recently and found that the hotel has kept its standards since our last stay in January.

I took the skytrain to terminal 2 but...

yoyo2603,27-Jun-13,Melbourne,3,Expensive Overnight Stay,The Crown Plaza is a new clean modern business hotel very conveniently located for an overnight stay at the airport in Singapore when flying to Europe.

gchjlfoster,27-Jun-13,Suzhou China,5,Perfect just what we needed.,We stayed overnight with three kids in a twin room. While the room was small it was still great as bath was big.

charliebrownsnoopy,25-Jun-13,Toronto Canada,5,Conveniently located (not just to airport!),Had to catch an early flight the next morning so we decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza.

Virginia M,25-Jun-13,Townsville Australia,4,Very Luxurious,We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night. It was easy access from the terminal and great when travelling with children.

We were exhausted after a long trip from Chengdu China on Silk Air...
mareepsasja,23-Jun-13,Surrey United Kingdom,4,If only the wi-fi wasnt so exorbitantly priced,We have stayed at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Hotel several times - most recently en route to London and then back again. The previous time was when we were returning from living in the UK for a couple of years (back in 2009).This is a great option to break up the hideous long-haul flight between Sydney and London....
Marqui_D,20-Jun-13,Melbourne Australia,5,Good for flight stopover if flight departs after 7.30am,Large room best bathroom Ive seen in a hotel - shower and spa bath and plenty of room. We booked online in advance and we asked for a quiet room which we got - on a higher floor and facing the road - the room seems to have sound proofing so not sure it would have mattered where the room...
aussie9082,20-Jun-13,null,3,Good for a stopover but overpriced,The location was great as its in the airport so it was easy as we stayed for one night but not really worth the $280 you pay for one night you have to pay $11 if you want to use wifi! Rip off. And the pool/restaurants close too early so didnt get to use any wouldnt do it again
BEACHSUN1961,20-Jun-13,New Delhi India,4,Very good Location,This Hotel does have a very good location and it is a top friendly Airporthotel in Singapore. Although we had been there just for one short Night we can say that it is a good Hotel with a very friendly Service.

TCU61,19-Jun-13,Greensboro North Carolina,5,Wonderful location and service for the traveler...,Arrived into Singapore in the wee hours. Decided to use the Crowne Plaza at the airport for a night (hours) of rest before heading into Singapore proper.

The only setback is the amount of time it takes to travel to...
LoneRanger27,18-Jun-13,Macau China,4,Good for short stay expensive Internet,Located at T3. Quiet room despite window facing the runway. Easy access to amenities. Wired Internet very costly at SGD29 and no wireless in room. I was given a handicap room and not being inform beforehand. Good choice for a short stay but wireless Internet should be available in the rooms.
59TRISH,17-Jun-13,Invercargill New Zealand,5,Just Right,We recently ended up having to spend an unexpected night in Singapore arriving late at night without any accommodation booked and this hotel was just what we needed. A lovely large room looking out over the airport a gorgeous big glassed in bathroom with a bath plus a shower. No noise considering the proximity to the airport and a bonus...
evansclan,16-Jun-13,Sydney,4,A cut above other airport hotels,I was really impressed with the Crowne Plaza particularly given with bright cheery & attentive staff at 2am. The room was way above my expectation and whilst my room looked directly over the runway it was incredibly quiet (how do they do that ??). The room itself was ultra modern but quite welcoming and I loved the bathroom. All in...

Im used to airport hotels being more utilitarian than luxurious but this was truly the exception. We stayed in a Club King room meaning that in addition to our huge King room we also had access to the Club lounge.We arrived in the early...
Reefwatcher,13-Jun-13,Topeka KS,2,Pretty But Annoying,Okay the room is pretty and the location in Terminal 3 is convenient. Unfortunately thats where the pluses end. My one night at this hotel was a continuing series of annoyances and missed opportunities.First upon checking in I was told unfortunately your Priority Club membership does not provide free wifi at this property. Well it does at every other...
TravelItAus,12-Jun-13,Sydney Australia,5,A perfect layover hotel,We had an overnight layover and found the crowne plaza to be just the relaxing break we needed in our long haul flight from sydney to Europe.

BeautyTravels,10-Jun-13,null,1,Midnight Caller!!,I had the most horrendous experience at this hotel!! A stranger actually entered my room at 01.30 am!! I am a female who was staying alone in the room. I woke to the sound of the door opening. Someone came in then left quickly. 5 minutes later I had a call from a Nadine in reception asking has someone tried...

PandanBear,10-Jun-13,Adelaide Australia,5,Try a club room,I stayed at this hotel last year and just recently stayed again but chose a Club room. The room itself was the same our previous stay with first class amenities however it was situated to the side of the airport runway which made it quieter for sleeping. The Club room also allows you access to the club bar which provides...
matthew f,10-Jun-13,Sydney Australia,5,One of the best airport hotels around,A very modern hotel that is perfect if you have a long stopover and dont want to stay in one of the transit hotels inside the terminals.The hotel is right above the MRT station and so you can easily get around Singapore cheaply by train from the hotel. You will be in the city in around 30 minutes.The...
fitzrovians,09-Jun-13,Melbourne Australia,5,Superb accommodation at Terminal 3,We stayed here twice at the start and end of our trip. For transiting the location is excellent (after clearing customs and immigration on arrival) with a short train shuttle from Terminals 1 or 2. The entrance is right next to the Terminal 3 stop. The room on both occasions was superb. Very clean with contemporary furnishings and comfortable bed...
Horizon_The_Island,09-Jun-13,Dunedin New Zealand,4,Convenient stop over hotel at Changi Airport,I stayed here twice in May 2013 on a return business trip between France and Australia. The Crowne Plaza Changi Airport was an excellent choice for an overnight stop-over in Singapore between Marseilles (via Frankfurt) and Sydney. I have found SIngapore hotels to be increasingly expensive in the past 10 years and if paying for flights myself tend to stopover...
woollysmum,08-Jun-13,Melbourne,5,Loved our stopover at Crowne Plaza!,Our flight arrived at T2 we cleared customs then caught the Sky Train to T3. Couldn’t believe how short the walk was then to Crowne Plaza. The check in was effortless then up to our room on the 9th Floor.At first I was a little confused by the open corridors mostly because it was so hot! But I soon...
James G,08-Jun-13,Sydney Australia,5,Convenient,High end boutique feel very architectural. Great location inside T3 terminal. Catch free sky train and walk 100 m and you are there. Be careful if you are a party of 3 and want an extra bed. We booked for 3 adults and the cost for extra person showed up on Expedia cost summary but not cost of extra bed....
DT94024,05-Jun-13,Los Altos California,4,Crowne Changi Airport,I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport for 7 nights in 3 different stays in May (I used Changi as my hub to go around the Southeast Asian countries). First I think it was a very good airport hotel. The location is simply unbeatable. It was attached to T3 and a short tram ride away from T1&2. Several times...
LuxJw,04-Jun-13,Singapore Singapore,4,Above average,Hotel has a great location easily accessible within terminal. I think room rate at was okay - factoring the taxi fare to and from city. However taxi is still required if you would like to dine away from the airport (places like Pasir Ris or Tampines).I didnt understand the extra $30 for double occupancy when it does not include...
sunshinenshowers,03-Jun-13,York United Kingdom,5,Fantastic room,Although I only spent one night here I wish I could have stayed longer. The room was clean and brilliantly equipped décor very pleasant (more like a boutique hotel) - everything top notch real attention to detail. In terms of access to the city things couldnt have been easier via the MRT (tube equivalent) (2 mins from the hotel).
Dawn H,03-Jun-13,Bossier City,4,Wont stay again,Yes a beautiful hotel. We chose it because we had s very early flight and you can walk right out of the hotel to the Airport. The pool is awesome. And we had great room service served at the pool.The big downfall was that after paying $275 for room you were required to pay another $29 for Internet. We...

The service is impeccable the thought put into travellers convenience is second to none and nothing is a problem.As most travellers have told you how to get there I will list my Hot and Nots about this hotel though I must say the Nots are very very limited. We...
jeremy0,02-Jun-13,ipoh,5,Room price a bit steep but worth every penny!,We had arrived late at night after a whole day flying from NZ. Rather than taking a cab to the city for our next flight back to KL we stayed a night at the Crowne Plaza Changi. It is located at T3 which means after leaving immigration at T1 you need to take a lift up and head towards the...
Judie2011,01-Jun-13,Melbourne Australia,4,Ultra-convenient stylish location for between flights,I often have one night at the Crowne Plaza as I hate night flights. Well appointed rooms with wildly differing views - havent tried asking for one overlooking Runway 02L yet though. Reception deals with check in and check out well although there can be a bit of a logjam around 7am. When travelling alone it isnt much fun going...
airlinesimulation,01-Jun-13,Sydney,5,Absolute fantastic airport hotel!,Wow. I am impressed. the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Hotel is a brilliant hotel by any standards and considering it is an airport hotel it rates even higher in my evaluation. Quiet.

Mayaaaaa,31-May-13,Singapore Singapore,4,Secret gem,We had the room overlooking the pool and the Changi iconic air traffic control tower. Room was clean and tidy. Huge bathroom with lined mirrors. Wish they didnt send us someone who cant speak english up to our room when we requested for our toiletries.
Nickg450,30-May-13,Bakewell United Kingdom,4,Quick stop,This hotel is perfectly located for a quick overnight stay to make an early morning connection it is directly at the airport and easy walking distance from check-in. Rooms and style is very different to a usual airport hotel - ie actually quite nice! Disappointing though that even though rooms are super expensive there is no free wifi.
chowvi,30-May-13,Kuala Lumpur Malaysia,4,Perfect for plane spotting,Stayed for one night and remember to request for a room overlooking Runway 02L. Aircraft usually land on this runway. These rooms are located the furthest away from the lifts. Also go for rooms on the higher floors to get maximum view.
Donna F,30-May-13,Mooloolaba Queensland Australia,5,Great stopover,We had a night here waiting on our flights home. Is just so handy to the airport was neat and clean and tidy. Only down side I could hear the planes at night although not to bad it did take a while to go to sleep

harvlaw,29-May-13,Beijing China,5,Nice place to crash overnight,My wife and I stayed at the Crowne Plaze for one night following a late-night arrival and subsequent departure the next day. The check-in process was fast and efficient. The rooms was larger and exceeded my expectations. Many of the rooms overlooked the terminal/runway and were great venues for watching the airplanes. Despite the location the rooms were quiet. With...
Caris25,28-May-13,Paris France,4,Convenient location but no wifi in rooms only wired and expensive!,I spent a very short night between flights recently at this modern hotel attached to Changi Airport. Easily accessible from the terminal I was assigned a room on a floor where having caught the elevator you needed to go through an open air (hence non airconditioned) corridor before reaching the room.....a great disappointment having in mind the heat and humidity...
Dave C,28-May-13,Los Angeles California,4,Convienent after a long flight,After a long flight and arriving at the Singapore airport after midnight I didnt want to take a taxi into town so I booked a night at the Crown Plaza (check for pre-paid special rate).

StewyNT,26-May-13,Darwin Australia,4,Great for stopover,When you arrive in Singapore late and flying out early the next day you cant go past this hotel from collecting baggage to being in a nice comfy bed including checkin max 15 minutes so convenient. Got in too late to try the hotel facilities but looked nice.
Rick D,26-May-13,null,5,Changi an example to the world again,Again stayed here then on to Heathrow. Ambassador transit here is excellent staff terrific. Compared to T5 hotel at Heathrow the ease of getting to your available fully functional room via excellent staff is a weary travellers dream. Score this as 11/10 again. I have been staying in Changi transits for over 20 years. I wish all around the world...
cyberbob2000,24-May-13,Zürich,5,Very convenient,The Crowne Plaza is great. Very modern and spacious rooms convenient location friendly staff. We enjoyed this hotel for our stop-over between two flights. The pool is large clean and very pleasant. The food options in the hotel are not that great but there are so many options in the shopping mall in Terminal 3 (T3).
Al L,23-May-13,null,4,Nice hotel,What i like about this hotel is that its in the airport. Food and shopping is around the area so u dont need to go elsewhere. And of course its the end of the train station which i like and easy to remember when you are new in SG. Its clean the bed is so comfortable i must say and...
RedandBlueSwimmer,23-May-13,New Delhi India,4,Very convenient,Very convenient for us - just beside the Airport and we went in just few Minutes there. Large Hotel with a friendly Service. Large Room (Room was quiet although directly at Airport). Good Restaurant and Lobby (all quiet and very clean).
Aradsportman,23-May-13,New Delhi India,4,a pretty good airporthotel,duea long layover we decided to spend the night at this hotel because it was not far away from the airport (just a few minutes). service could be little bit more customerorientated but all other things had been good. comfortable interiour and a good selection at breakfast.
AndrewMcK,23-May-13,Sydney Australia,5,Great airport hotel,Stayed at the Crowne Plaza twice on the way through Singapore.It is a very modern hotel accessed from Terminal 2. The rooms and common areas are impeccably kept and the beds are terrifically comfortable.We ate at the restaurant one night and the buffet on offer was one of the best weve had - although at $S75 it isnt...
Brazilian F,22-May-13,null,4,Convenient location expected more in terms of service,Since I was staying in the city for less than 1 day I chose this hotel because of the location. It is inside the airport but after customs and luggage claim so I could leave my things and go to the city for a tour and then come back to shower before my flight. Room is new and bathroom is...
SharkFlorida_USA,22-May-13,Florida USA,5,For A Night Or Two As Convenient & Nice As Youll Find,If youre only in Singapore for a night or two this is a great place to stay. After untold hours on a plane theres nothing better than collecting your bags and having a very brief walk to the hotel registration desk. Once there the metro or cabs are right there and you can get anywhere in 20-30 minutes. We were...
divingdawn,22-May-13,Leominster,5,Free upgrade - cant be bad,We decided to sleep in comfort instead of spending hours waiting for a connection and spending money at Changi Airport. I paid in Airmiles (Avios) and got a free upgrade to the executive floor on arrival. The room was a typical group hotel executive room - crisp clean all glass and state. We caught the MTR into town and has...
PriyankaS4,21-May-13,Bengaluru India,3,Its alright not great!,I stayed two weeks at this hotel. Location and access to food courts is good. However the staffs response to facilities in room is not very good. I wasn given drinking water unless i asked for it. The room size is big but its just big thats all.
tbuehlma,16-May-13,Phoenix,4,Great Place for Stay Over,Just spent a week working in Singapore close to the airport. the Crowne Plaza in Terminal 3 proved to be a cheap hotel offering a full range of services. At the same time its location in Terminal 3 allowed to easily get out of the hotel and use the great many facilities and services available in this terminal.I stayed...
moochharvey,15-May-13,Dubbo Australia,5,Stopover,Omg!!!! this hotel is beautiful. My family of 5 stayed here for a stopover from Phuket heading on to Sydney early the next morning.

virtualbma,14-May-13,Downham Market United Kingdom,2,Never want to stop here again,I should start by saying its clean tidy staff are friendly which to be fair is the basics. However Ive never been in such a dark and dingy lobby Internet connectivity is extortionate even for a Singapore business hotel (Ive stayed in most of the decent ones). The food is mostly buffet based and for Singapore very average indeed quite...
Rahulgupta1983,13-May-13,Mumbai (Bombay) India,4,Very good place for odd time flights,I had flight landing and departing at very odd time. Choosing this hotel proved quite useful.

KAE4,13-May-13,Seattle Washington,2,Dear Crowne Plaza its 2013.,The Crowne Plaza is very convenient and rooms are fairly nice for an airport hotel. Small items like no outlets near the bed and extremely slow check-in and check-out would keep it from being a five-star but this would be a four-star review were it not for one thing: no wireless internet unless you pay an extra $30 for a...

TulltheTraveller_8,02-May-13,Adelaide,5,I wish this was closer to town,Used this as a single night stop over from Australia with the family. Well located but we had some intial confusion in finding as we thought it was airside-its not. Connects conveniently through the terminal.

TanjungBaraDiver,30-Apr-13,Kerobokan Indonesia,4,Another good stay,Our family had another good stay here. A bit pricey but convenient to the airport especially with those early morning flights.

Larry_Brotherton,22-Apr-13,St Albans United Kingdom,4,Spacious and a bit out of the ordinary....,I stayed at this hotel a couple of times for a week+ whilst working out of the city towards the airport.

MajorKusanagi,13-Apr-13,Perth,4,Ticks all the boxes,We were on a relatively tight transit schedule through Singapore but wanted a decent sleep before the next flight. So a King Bed Deluxe Non Smoking Room was booked via the hotel web-site for 22/12/12.Lobby color scheme definitely helps with jet-lag. Room is identical to web-site photos. Unfortunately I do not remember the room number but it was facing...
Kommandousen,13-Apr-13,Den Haag,5,Very nice airport hotel.,Normally I would avoid airport hotels. But this time my trip to Singapore was so short I only needed a day room.

DrWookie,12-Apr-13,Portland,3,inadequacies for their major customer groups,Like all airport hotels the Crowne Plaza mostly caters to two groups of related people.

Jaynyc2,11-Apr-13,New Rochelle New York,5,Amazingly convenient to Changi Airport,I love staying at this hotel every year when it is my last night in Singapore (and it is a morning flight).

Clear_Brook_Rae,11-Apr-13,Singapore,5,An Airport Staycation,Even for non-transit guests like us we enjoyed the staycation here. The hotel is linked to the airport Terminal 3 and we booked 2 nights stay. The tropical flower motif blended cleverly with the building structure thus no one is able to look into the guest rooms despite the vicinity of the monorail. The check-in is comparatively slower as it...
Amanda S,11-Apr-13,Melbourne Australia,5,Perfect airport hotel,I think the Crowne Plaza at terminal 3 is great you just grab your bags out the door turn left and there you are.

tulipjones,09-Apr-13,Taipei,5,Gorgeous airport hotel,Best possible score for location cleanliness food and service (with a smile). Rooms are huge and comfortable. Only gripe is the noise from the planes in the morning but I had requested a high floor with a runway view so maybe it wasnt as soundproof as I had expected.

authorgirl,06-Apr-13,Yarragon Australia,4,Extremely convenient,We essentially chose this hotel just for the convenience of staying right at the airport when in transit and in that sense it performs brilliantly. Our room was stylish and comfortable and the breakfast is varied and delicious. Service at the front desk was efficient rather than welcoming but the restaurant staff were very friendly. The Crowne Plaza is by...

Neem D,03-Apr-13,New York City New York,4,so convenient!,This hotel is right in the airport! we were exhausted from traveling so it was great to have a rest on our way to Bali. A bit expensive and more than we wanted to pay but worth it. We arrived in Bali rested.

RobinW55,15-Mar-13,Orlando Florida,4,Convenient sleepover,Located directly in T3 and a 3-4 minute walk from baggage claim and immigration. Extremely pricy wifi is $30/day and hallways are outdoors and muggy. Many have mentioned airport sounds but we did not have any issues with that. Bed and linens very nice.

Tltravels,14-Mar-13,Hartford Connecticut,4,Good for one night!,Convenient for only one night in Singapore. Room was basic but comfortable. Clean property. Nice pool. Rained when we were there and hallways (no walls) were very wet. Breakfast buffet was almost $40 USD. Ate in kopi (asian foodcourt). Interesting to see the runway from our room but obviously you can hear the planes. Would stay again.

DannyManning,12-Mar-13,Toronto Canada,3,Good but hardly great,I was here for a 14-hour stopover booked through Hotwire where I technically didnt know the location but in reality was aware that my booking was the Crowne.

I waited 2 minutes for check in and the manager came out immediately and apologised! Breakfast is a feast and the spa a delight.
whichcitynow,08-Mar-13,Portland Oregon,4,Highway Robbery?,Because my flights to go home are always very early it is just better for me to stay at this place than somewhere in downtown Singapore. If youre lugging your bags to the Terminal 1 at 4 in the morning it also pays to get a taxi for the 3-minute ride as the Skytrain does not operate till 5am and...
ADAMLG,08-Mar-13,Surabaya Indonesia,5,Great Airport Hotel!,This along with the Sheraton in Frankfurt might be the best airport hotel in the world. I normally allocate all of my stays to Starwood and Hyatt.

Jaroslaw S,02-Mar-13,Washington DC District of Columbia,3,need sound-proof rooms,Beautiful hotel with nice service average food great location just at one of Singapore airport terminals but....do not plan to have a good sleep there - the noise of landing and taking off planes is horrible and the staff says they cannot help you in any at this hotel.Good to take shower refresh and leave after couple of hours.
Sarah T,01-Mar-13,Melbourne,2,Nice pool pity about the slamming doors,The rooms are large and comfortable the pool area is nice (transport buffs will enjoy watching planes take off and land!) and the location is convenient for a stopover or even if you are visiting Singapore for a couple of days.However the large heavy doors on the rooms are set to slam mode. I know most hotel doors close...
RandSand,01-Mar-13,Poway California,4,Nice but,We booked our stay through the Crowne Plaza website. The website appeared to guarantee the lowest price so we prepaid for the room.

BrissyGirl00,28-Feb-13,Brisbane,5,Location is the seller,I spent one night here on route to Bangkok. The hotel is expensive but convenient. I could have stayed in the city and got taxis or the train to and from the airport but is was much easier to get the free sky train (a one minute journey) from terminal 1 to terminal 3 and go to the hotel. After...

Pelorojo13,26-Feb-13,Dallas Texas,4,Great way to get to the airport for an early flight,As with most people we stayed only one night and you cant beat the convenience of this hotel especially if you are leaving from Terminal 3.

DonFTL,24-Feb-13,San Diego California,5,Best airport hotel - ever,This place was a complete surprise and of a MUCH higher quality than the other Crowne Plaza hotels Ive stayed in before.

CelestialStar12,23-Feb-13,Singapore Singapore,4,Quiet staycation away from city and awesome for plane spotting,Design of the hotel is chic and classy. We had the room facing the runway which I think is perfect for plane spotting. Fear not the room will not be that noisy as you expect to be since it was near the runway. My child is able to sleep well through the night. The room is reasonably huge with a...
beakytraveller,22-Feb-13,London,2,Very underwhelmed all round,It is conveniently located right next to one of the shuttle trains the room was spacious and breakfast was palatable. However this is where the good times ended:They charge 35 SGD (28 USD 20 GBP) for use of the slow internet in their hotel. May I suggest that in 2013 in one of the technology hubs of the world...
Jay K,21-Feb-13,Washington DC District of Columbia,4,Attached to Changi Airport,Arrived in Singapore after midnight this week and the hotel is literally attached to the airport. From baggage claim in terminal 3 turn left and walk approximately 300 feet. Interestingly the corridors of the hotel are an exoskelaton - they are exposed to the outdoors (similar to a motel in America); thus only the rooms are air-conditioned. Since I got...

Poliwhirl,02-Feb-13,Hong Kong China,4,Nice hotel but annoying extra charge for wifi,Good modern hotel directly accessible from Changi Terminal 3. Expensive even with a corporate rate and then when you add on the $SIN 50 package for breakfast and wifi and then the mandatory service charge (10%) and GST (7%) you end up paying an additional $SIN 100 on the basic room rate. Room is very nice clean and spacious. My...

Ron B,24-Jan-13,London United Kingdom,5,Location could not be better.,A first rate hotel right at Terminal 3 at Changi out of arrivals and a short stagger to the entrance could not be closer.

umfan87,22-Jan-13,Perth Australia,4,High Quality Transfer Hotel,We had a 17 hour layover in Singapore and the Changi Transfer Hotel was fully booked. With two young kids we opted to book a room here rather than travel into the city. The room was very nice with a separate sleeping area made up for the children. The pool was amazing. The breakfast buffet was plentiful. It was a...
Xplorer1Melbourne,22-Jan-13,Melbourne Australia,1,A high price for Convenience but with helpful service,After a good flight and service via Jetstar Business we arrived at Terminal 1.

It couldnt have been more comfortable or convenient.
Ron B,21-Jan-13,Newcastle NSW,4,Very Handy,Stayed here at the end of a Singapore Holiday as I had an early flight. Super handy to the 3 terminals by the skytrain which goes every 4 minutes. The dinner buffet was OK but not sensational & the beer in the bar nice and cold. The room was fine overlooking the runway however despite their claims you can here...

Pratish M,20-Jan-13,Bengaluru India,3,Best choice for an overnighter if you have business in Changi,I was in Singapore on a business trip and ended up staying at the Crowne Plaza for two nights. I had requested for an early check-in but that didnt work out for me (though it did for my two colleagues).The best thing about the hotel is its proximity to Changi Business Park (and the airport): If your work is...
SandyCaroline,20-Jan-13,Sydney Australia,2,Convenience outweighed by poor service,We stayed at the CP Changi in order to catch a 7am flight requested a 5.30am wakeup call on checkin.

XmasKid,10-Jan-13,Auckland Region New Zealand,4,More Zzzzzs for early flights,We decided to stay at the airport Crowne Plaza instead of a city hotel on a recent stopover in Singapore as we worked out that it would be worth an extra hour of sleep before catching our early morning flights.I was surprised to find a really comfortable establishment instead of the usual sterile airport hotels. Our rooms were spacious...

The hotel was really full.This is my second stay and this time it was during...
cliffnmontgomery,07-Jan-13,Singapore Singapore,3,Good value,The room was discounted on Expedia to $225.

Staff was very pleasant and helpful.The room was advertised as non-smoking but smelled...
akbarb1,06-Jan-13,Austin Texas,4,Excellent option after a long flight,I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Changi for one night after a long flight from North America. Other members of my party were arriving several hours later so this ended up being a great option as I waited for them to arrive.

But the bedroom was fantastic as well as the bathroom. I can see...

Mamanabee,01-Jan-13,Tokyo Japan,3,Breathtakingly expensive,On more than one occasion I have had to contend with a stopover in Singapore that is too long to wait out in an airport lounge and to short to warrant heading into town to find better value.

Katrina70,29-Dec-12,Brisbane Australia,4,The best airport hotel anywhere,I stayed at the Crowne Plaza with 3 children to break up a long trip from Europe to Australia. It is the best airport hotel I have ever stayed at with a few small faults preventing me giving it full marks. The good first: the location is superb - right at Terminal 3 and you can wheel your baggage trolley...
mnp96,28-Dec-12,-,3,Just OK,We stayed one night in the hotel before our onward flight the following evening. Trying to find the hotel from within the airport wasn’t that straight forward even with a previous reviewer’s instructions as there are no signs anywhere and the entrance looks like a dark tunnel. The actual room was nice and there was no airport noise. There was...

HoustonBaze,22-Dec-12,Houston,3,Overpriced and virtually no benefits for platinums,Paid about 350 US for one night here. Room was noisy from planes taking off and Internet did not work well despite 29 dollar per day cost. Staff was not very platinum friendly. Claimed hotel was sold out so I got an average room. Biggest issue is that the hotel is such a poor value. Dont stay here unless you...

baroda2borneo,14-Dec-12,Nottingham,3,Drop in standards,We have stayed at the Crowne Plaza on several occasions now. Our most recent stay has left us somewhat dismayed. We feel the overall standard of service has dropped. Restocking of items in the room by housekeeping is patchy often missing out things. The number of tea bags and milk cartons is just enough for two cups and no more....

Exline,08-Dec-12,Hong Kong China,3,Ask Many Questions before signing,This hotel is exactly what they say it is - an airport hotel. It is literally over the gates so you can see the people boarding and disembarking. There is no way to silence an A-380 and they all leave around midnight. That is fine. The rooms are large and clean. The irritation came when asking about WiFi and (after...
Tracy J,07-Dec-12,Dundee Beach Australia,4,Pricey but excellent for a stopover,This is an excellent quality hotel. A little pricey for a quick stopover - we were only there for 8 hours before our connecting flight. However the room was much better than expected and a little bit of luxury. Frankly when I only want somewhere to sleep for 5 or 6 hours I dont need this level of room and...

This is a fantastic service helping people in need of assistance....
AssimilatedCajun,03-Dec-12,Breaux Bridge Louisiana,3,OK airport hotel but not worth the high price,This is a decent airport hotel -- comfortable rooms not too noisy and literally just a few steps from Terminal 3 -- but its awfully expensive for what you get priced in the same range as far more luxurious hotels downtown.

Mario060,30-Nov-12,Graz,4,Airport Hotel,This hotel is not meant for a longer stay in Singapore. When spending a night or only some hours while connecting to another flight at Singapore Airport however this is a very good choice since it is literally at the airport. For this purpose it features everything one needs without being too stylish or exclusive.
Alexandra R,30-Nov-12,London United Kingdom,4,Nice stay for a transit,I had a lovely stay at the Crowne Plaza.The buffet breakfast is good.It is convenient for a short stay such as a transit but not a good idea to stay at the Crowne if you are planing to visit Singaporeits a bit too far and it will cost you a fortune to go to town.The downsides are:...

Daniel K,26-Nov-12,Penang Island Malaysia,4,If you need to be near Changi,We stayed here for the weekend because we had to attend a wedding at the same hotel. It was very convenient for us having to travel with our 2-year old - a train ride from Terminal 1. Foods easy too with ample choices at Changi.Service was excellent from the Front desk to housekeeping to the folks who pick up...

Two sections for food western and asian fantastic set up and...
Swagfella,21-Nov-12,Sydney,5,For a stopover cant be beaten,Just about the ultimate location for a Singapore stopover you dont even leave the airport terminal. The hotel is built into T3.You have a room choice of runway view or motorway view. We were allocated the runway view and quite soon felt on intimate terms with the Singapore Airlines baggage handlers. Closing the curtains to screen out our new...
nickpanda,19-Nov-12,East Kent,5,Singapore Stopover,The older we get  the more taxing the flight to Australia so what better way to split the journey than with an overnight stay at the most convenient hotel at Singapore Changi Airport.Situated next to the Arrivals Hall in Terminal 3 we were checking in within 30 minutes of landing.The Crowne Plaza is splendidly modern in concept...
travelbug_travelbug,19-Nov-12,Australia,5,Great overnight stay,Great hotel for stop over. Part of T3. Easy transfer from all terminals.Lovely hotel. Room was great. Good friendly staff. We arrived in late at night and left early the next day. Would stay again if I had a stop over.
bettibMissouri,18-Nov-12,Union Missouri,5,BB Missouri,My last day of my vacation was spent at the changi crowne plaza hotel. The room was one of the nicest well appointed rooms I have stayed. Fantastic bathroom! Bathrobes many towels washcloths! Outstanding decor. I wish I had more time to spend there. Staff was very courteous and of course the location for traveling MRT at the doorstep. Taxi...
Gabby_travelbug,17-Nov-12,Siem Reap Cambodia,5,Relaxing overnight stop,Great hotel for an overnight stop at Singapore airport. Room was very beautiful and clean. Only downside is the internet: which is overpriced. Definitely recommend the buffet dinner at the restaurant: that was excellent!
Victoria A,17-Nov-12,Sedona,4,Convenient Location Disappointed with paying for Wifi,Convenient hotel for 1 night lay-over located next to the airport. The rooms were ok if you like ultra-modern and lots of glass... the hotel is very pricey the restaurant is also extremely expensive however the lobby is beautiful again lots of glass but this time they had interesting water features running through the glass a very striking effect. The...
ACS416,16-Nov-12,null,3,Great location bad wifi,I am reviewing for the sole purpose of chiming in to support comments other guests have made regarding the high cost for wifi. I find it completely ridiculous that a hotel attached to an airport that has free wifi feels the need to charge guests for the same service. I was there for one night and there was an issue...
A L,16-Nov-12,Dublin California,5,Expensive treat!,Enjoyed our quick late-night stopover at this beautiful hotel. Pricey and luxurious but the room was one of the largest hotel rooms that Ive stayed in. It had a large bathroom with a separate shower and tub as well.It was very convenient to be able to transport our luggage cart right up to the hotel entrance. The hotel staff...
Lovetotravel19671970,15-Nov-12,Brisbane Australia,1,TERRIBLE,Dont waste your money ! i arrived at Singapore airport at midnight and thought it would be easier ( since i was travelling alone ) to just check in here and have a good sleep . I was given a room lower level which was VERY NOISY  i kept hearing banging doors and people talking  it looked like...
Jmor2005,14-Nov-12,null,5,Fab pool area and delightful staff,One night stay in transit from Aus back to UK. Linked directly to the airport so check in was a breeze. We used the pool area before and after check out as we still had several hours to kill prior to next flight. It is a tropical paradise and towels and showers available. In room WiFi is expensive however free...
Richard H,13-Nov-12,Melbourne Australia,5,Great airport hotel,An oasis in Changi Airport. Stayed overnight between flights and had dinner with friends in downtown Singapore. This is a very smart hotel with beautiful contemporary rooms containing every conceivable facility. We didnt get much of a chance to use any of this hotels other facilities but if they match the standard of the room then nobody has anything to...
OliK75,12-Nov-12,Jakarta,4,Restful stay,Stayed for a night with wife and daughter to be near the airport for an early morning flight. We booked and paid for the room through a hotel reservations counter at Changi and got a rate that was cheaper than if we had booked directly with the hotel.Initial reaction to the hotel was one of curiosity as the entire...
DanielWeiHo,10-Nov-12,Houston,4,Youre not that far from everything!,I stayed here because I had to conduct some meetings near the airport during the first half of the week (at the Changi Business Park) but the problem was that I also had business in the city during the second half. I considered moving to a more centric (and much pricier) hotel for the remainder of the week especially since...
shp73,09-Nov-12,london,4,Rainforest at the airport,Its hard to believe this airport is at Terminal 3 with the only plane noise being a dull hum when outside. The hotel is open-plan (i.e. corridors / public areas are outside - only rooms lounges restaurants are air-conditioned) and centred around a beautiful pool with numerous trees / shrubs. Feels like a rainforest at times. My room (deluxe double)...
CPHBear,09-Nov-12,Copenhagen Denmark,4,A stone throw from Changi Airport,This is the first hotel we stayed at on our Singapore trip Xmas 2011. We arrived late (11pm) so we decided to stay very close to the airport. The hotel is located next to the terminal 3 and you can push your luggage trolley right into the hotel lobby (the walkway was indoors and there was no stairs so the...
george g,09-Nov-12,Allentown Pennsylvania,3,Singapore airport Crowne Plaza,Expensive but was convenient to be right at airport for late flight in and early flight out. But know this - this the ONLY Holiday Inn brand hotel in the world that I have experienced where as a Platinum member they do not provide free internet service as well as free local and toll free phone calls. $4.82 for every...
KiloTango,09-Nov-12,OC California,5,Bout the most conveinent airport hotel there is.,I like this hotel. The entrance to the hotel is just off the departure lobby in Terminal 3 but is also just along side the shuttle train to Terminals 1 and 2 so convenient to to the entire airport. It is also a very short walk to the SMRT station which means within a little more than a half hour...
brisfamilyholiday,07-Nov-12,Queensland,5,Such a convenient and luxurious Singapore stopover,We arrived back into Singapore at 3pm after 4 weeks in Europe and departed the next morning back for Australia. On arrival at Singapore airport into Terminal 3 we cleared customs with our hand luggage as our bags were already checked thru to Brisbane. we then simply walked through the terminal without having to leave the airport and directly into...
LauraB3773,07-Nov-12,Richmond Virginia,4,Convenient Hotel for a Quick Trip to Singapore,The best thing about this hotel - is that it is in Terminal 3 of the airport. You get off the plane and just roll your luggage up a small ramp and you are in the hotel! Very easy! Also quite convenient for early morning departures. I thought it was pretty pricy but all of Singapore is. You access your...
NIFT,07-Nov-12,Sydney,5,Awesome airport hotel,This is an example of what all airport hotels should be. You walk in/out straight onto terminal 3 so if you have an early or late flight you can take any travel time out of the equation. Great big modern rooms with a great tub in the bathroom. Awesome pool and gym to unwind. They have a bar with reasonably...
melbermar,06-Nov-12,Salisbury Wilts.,4,Almost perfect,Lovely hotel right inside the airport. Very convenient for early morning flights and it is possible to print your boarding card in the hotel which saves time.The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. One strange thing though - the bathroom/toilet are separated from the bedroom by a transparent wall so you have no privacy. Make sure you share...
lizzimacc,06-Nov-12,New York City New York,5,Convenience & Comfort,We arrived late at night and had an early flight the next morning. After quickly clearing immigration and customs we proceeded to take an internal train from terminal 1 to terminal 3 then walked less than a minute and we in the hotel reception.

Steph L,06-Nov-12,Sydney Australia,5,Convenient & Beautiful Airport Hotel,We stayed here for almost 2 nights (checked out at midnight for a 2am flight). Its right outside Terminal 3 and is easy to access from the other terminals.Service: Service was mostly good. There was a section for Gold and Platinum Elite members to check in but there was no one there so there was no sort of express...
JotaJota56,06-Nov-12,Houston Texas,2,Only if you have an early flight,Location is very convenient right next to Terminal 3 and the train that goes to other Terminals.I did not like the bathroom walls and door made all of glass. Rest of the room was fine.The dinner buffet was overpriced for the quality of the offerings. Given the cost of the rooms having to pay extra for Internet is...
RDAM_11,06-Nov-12,Hong Kong China,4,A reliable airport hotel,3rd visit to this hotel. Good clean comfortable and reliable. Could have more receptionists on duty (can sometimes take an age to check out). Definitely not worth going into Singapore for your hotel if you are just overnighting.
glaushouse,06-Nov-12,Perth,3,A lot of money for what you get,Very overpriced hotel. Nice room nothing special. Good restaurants but pricey. Would not bother staying there again. We paid nearly $300AUS for one night. They advertised on the internet the room as having a coffee maker. It was actually just a kettle. No biscuits supplied as in most hotels at half the price. One positive is it is a great...

Cameron0128,27-Oct-12,Sydney Australia,5,Great overnight stay,I arrived at this hotel after a long & uncomfortable flight from Australia. I choose it because I had to continue my travel the next day. Initially I thought It was more expensive than I wanted to pay but would be worth it for the convenience. However on arrival I was so glad that I had chosen it. A friendly...

Dogosaur_X,12-Oct-12,Perth Australia,5,Convenient,Now the rooms are pricey but when I went in 2011 I had an employee discount... So for me it was value for money.

Staff were excellent. Their double twin room (with two double beds) easily catered for 2 adults and 2 kids (ring Singapore direct to get this dont use internet). Very spacious and impecably clean. Very quite room too....
sam63,11-Oct-12,darwin,5,So convenient,Building quite dark and gloomy initially however rooms are a different story. Great sized rooms lovely fresh decor and wonderful amenities. Asked for a runway view which kept my 9 year old and partner entertained watching flights arrive and depart for hours. Some spasmodic noise from planes but absolutely no other traffic noise ie beeping horns cars trucks etc!! Pool...
FreqFly,10-Oct-12,Brisbane Australia,4,Good location average room,This hotel is perfect for the short stopover on the way to Europe. Everything works well and it is generally OK. However for the price the room is small and it may be worth using the Transit notes within the airport. You dont have to clear immigration!
steve_fossil,10-Oct-12,Canberra - Australia,5,Thank You Crowne Plaza for the 7.00 AM Check In,We arrived at Changi Airport at 7.00 am yesterday after a 15 hour flight from Manchester.

Ashley J,09-Oct-12,shropshire,4,Convenient Airport Hotel,On our trips to Australia in the past we have endured the long flight without a stopover arriving in Oz knackered!This time we decided to break the journey by a 1 night stopover both ways. Great idea! We arrived in Singapore from London at 2.30pm leaving enough time to freshen up and catch the train which is located within...
Alessia88,08-Oct-12,Stoney Creek,5,Glad we ended up there...,We planned a two day stop over on our way to the Maldives over a year ago but the date of the Formula One Race was not on our Radar.

GinJose,06-Oct-12,Carlsbad California,4,Convenient and comfortable but come after dinner.,Although a little pricey even by Singapore standards this hotel is very comfortable. Rooms are modern and well equipped. I especially liked the fact that you could plug in your chargers on the desk top without need for an adaptor (universal outlets). Rooms were spotless and bathrooms were well equipped. The best and worst things about this hotel however is...
ggb88,06-Oct-12,Melbourne Australia,4,The Pool The Pool,The price of this hotel would put it out of the league of most travellers and honestly youre not missing much - except the pool. As far as a Crowne Plaza is concerned its at the standard youd expect the customer service is a bit lacking - but you expect that at an airport. The pool though is cool -...
Margaret V,06-Oct-12,Mermaid Waters,5,Peaceful oasis at Changi Airport,This is a very nice hotel easily accessed from the Airport. The staff are all quite charming and welcoming.

Lozeves,29-Sep-12,Solihull United Kingdom,5,Great hotel,I have just returned from 4 nights here after a family emergency. All the staff at this hotel were wonderful.

The entrance is at terminal 3 and do easy...
Pookie2199,26-Sep-12,Sydney Australia,4,If youre at the Airport.,At first I thought I had made the wrong choice in staying at this hotel when you enter the lobby it is very dark and unwelcoming ( later staff told me that is dark to make it more comfortable for people suffering jet-lag). The main advantage in staying at this hotel is the short walk to and from the airport...
jc0691,26-Sep-12,Brisbane Australia,5,Clean comfortable and convenient,We had a 24 hour stopover in Singapore and decided to stay at the airport rather than staying closer to town.The Crowne Plaza was excellent.

ellissea,26-Sep-12,Houston Texas,4,Used to be 5 now only 4,I fly through Singapore frequently and stay over at the Hotel. Unfortunately this past trips have seen a slide in the service and cleanliness of the room. Second there was no recognition of frequent stay either. So putting it out there Aug 2012 was not a 5 Star stay. Besides for the price they really should offer a breakfast!
w0rldtr4veler,25-Sep-12,Winchester Virginia,4,Very convenient for stop over,The queue for checking in was long during our stay because of a tour group from a Cruise ship. Had to wait 30 minutes for it other than that our stay was flawless.

adicae,22-Sep-12,Dubai United Arab Emirates,4,Perfect for short stay,I got a chance to stay for a night there when my flight to middle east was delayed.It was great easy access from all the terminals in changi by skytrain. Perhaps the only delay youll face is the queue at the customs during check-out from T3. And once youre out of T3 you can see directly the hotel area....
mkchak,22-Sep-12,Brisbane Australia,5,Lovely stop over,Stayed one night here. Was not enough! Singapore city a short train trip away. Very clean rooms. Nice bath tub for relaxing bath!

SNL_in_Tokyo,21-Sep-12,Tokyo Japan,3,Do they know what they are selling?,I have stayed here multiple times and always thought it was a fine hotel but this last stay made me think I will stay elsewhere going forward.We had a misunderstanding whether the rate included 1 or 2 breakfasts when the rate was advertised with 2 free breakfast but mistakenly (due to the travel agents system interface) booked with 1...

peninaanddave,17-Sep-12,Auckland Region New Zealand,5,fantastic for airport proximity,We stayed one night before an early morning flight - which meant a short stroll to our terminal.The hotel itself has a theme based on the frangipani flower - beautful attention to detail in the room. Loved the bathroom - admittedly it was for the disabled (which I pretty much was) - the shower was spacious and much enjoyed....
Clairedog,16-Sep-12,Annapolis Maryland,4,Convenient and pleasant but service was very slow on arrival and departure,This is a great hotel - stylish clean and convenient. Perhaps I wouldnt have noticed the slow service ordinarily but most people staying here have been traveling for 15-20 hours and so people are visibly (and audibly) impatient. Checking in at 1:00am took 25 minutes and checking out at 6:00am took almost as long. There were enough employees at the...

tomHD,11-Sep-12,Takaka New Zealand,4,Almost First Class,Its a pricy location and you get what you might expect for your money. The hotel is very conveniently located just in between the terminals of Changi airport (SIngapore) and has direct access to Terminal 3 with a own Sky Train access a few steps away. Design is quite strange (very dark) and the layout of the floors too: There...

James42_10,08-Sep-12,Melbourne Australia,4,Convenient quiet and comfortable airport hotel,I generally agree with other complimentary reviews here about the convenience and comfort of this airport hotel. I really like the gardens pool and open walkways between rooms which makes you realise how effective the double-glazed sound proofing is. The rooms are spacious and good quality for any hotel.

Weeseywoo,08-Sep-12,null,4,Not ideal for families but a handy pitstop,Stayed in this lovely hotel two days ago. My second time on a long stopover (too short for a hotel in the city but needing somewhere nice and restful). On the last occasion I was travelling alone with my infant son.This time with two preschoolers mid way home from Brisbane.The hotel is still gorgeous and the staff are...
50nightsperyr,07-Sep-12,Galway Ireland,4,Convenient and Enjoyable,Flying through Singapore recently I stayed at this hotel. It was at the airport and I had an early flight so I booked it based on its proximity to the airport. What I did not fully appreciate at the time of booking is that it is directly connected to terminal 3 and is amazingly convenient. The reception is directly off...
calatrava,06-Sep-12,perth,4,Good airport hotel,This is a very good airport hotel and if you have 6 hours or more to wile away well worth it.Howeve r the spa closes early as does the pool.Changi collects passengers from all 4 corners of the globe and at all times of day and night.Management nedd to understand this.This is not a hotel in a sleepy corner...

13Hawkeye,05-Sep-12,Adelaide Australia,5,Very convienient,We stayed there on two occassions on a recent trip to and from the UAE. First night we were upgraded as our chosen room had been booked out. This was pure luxury for 2 adults and included one and a half bathrooms. Overall it was very large and in fact probably a waste of space for an overnight stay. On...
pvrrp,02-Sep-12,null,1,Never select this hotel unless obsolutely required,We had a horrible experience in this hotel. First it is an open hotel all the corridors are open to sky and rain water will keep coming. The flooring is extremely slippery and one may get slipped very easily and break legs or head. Staff are extremely hostile and may be they are thinking they are doing a great favour...
Hussamuae,01-Sep-12,Abu Dhabi UAE,5,Excellent Airport Hotel,Luxurious airport hotel. Very spacious rooms and very accessible from all terminals. Stayed with my family on a layover to Phuket and it was all what we expected and more. The only downside was the price...a bit on the high side.
lemanieg,31-Aug-12,Nice France,5,Fabulous! The best pool for families Ive ever swum in,We only stayed here overnight and although it was pricey it was well worth it. The pool is fabulous.. it has many hidden corners due to trees in pots inside the pool and the kids loved playing hide and seek here. I love the fact that they have made a point of opening up the views to the runways instead...
sfy8,30-Aug-12,Kuala Lumpur Malaysia,5,excellent transit hotel,The location is in the same of our arriving and departing terminal. 1 minor hassle is we still need to fill in the arrival form and go through the imigresen on the way to the hotel.This is our stopover before proceed to go Saudi for performing Umrah.Really love the room.

BLINXS,30-Aug-12,Kuala Lumpur Malaysia,5,Great Airport Hotel,We stayed at this hotel for an overnight and find this place to be very convinience. The rooms are clean spacious and when you are travelling with the family youll be glad that they offer large comfortable bed to make your stay more enjoyable.The location is perfect for transiting Singapore as it is directly connected to the airport.
zzdianne,29-Aug-12,Brisbane Australia,4,Excellent stopover hotel,As the title says it was a stopover for us on our way to Europe. Sleep was what we needed due to our late departure (2.30am) from Australia.Crowne Plaza is in an ideal spot right at the airport and not having to go through customs makes it a quick and easy to get to your hotel.We arrived at the...

Sairaih,28-Aug-12,Brisbane Australia,5,Perfect for Airport hotel,Amazing airport hotel. Got a room for the day from 0900-1900. Included access to pool free amazing breakfast free amazing 2 hour snack and drink bar in the afternoon. And fantastic service. Definitely on the expensive side especially for a poor backpacker like myself but still the best $150 AUD Ive spent at a hotel!
KristyFin,27-Aug-12,Brisbane Australia,4,Modern Clean Large Rooms! Perfect for a stop over!!,We stayed at this hotel for two nights on our way back to Australia from the UK. The rooms are very modern and large. Very Very Clean and huge bathroom with a walk in shower (not a shower over the bath which I hate!)Only disappointing thing was once again no wifi!! I dont understand this day and age with...
afxdes,27-Aug-12,Melbourne,3,Fit for Purpose,This was my first visit to this hotel as we usually use the Transit Hotel (airside) for short visits. Reception was reasonably efficient though it would have taken much longer if we had been unlucky enough to arrive at the same time as one of the many flight crews. All staff we met were courteous.Our room was larger than...
salsasuave,27-Aug-12,Buenos Aires Argentina,4,Great service stunned to see shark fin soup on their menu,After arriving at the Crown Plaza hotel in Singapore I popped down to their Cantonese restaurant for lunch. I was stunned there was two pages on the menu devoted to shark fin soup. What happened to Corporate Social responsibility and why would my company put me up in a hotel that was still serving a threaten species? After lunch I...
StephSeow,26-Aug-12,Singapore,3,Average for a staycation,We chose the location for a staycation primarily cause it is far away from city center - allowing us to really focus on relaxing and not think about where to go next/what do we need to do next.The room was a reasonably comfortable size and provided the basic amenities of a business hotel. I liked the sofa in front...
openseas,26-Aug-12,SplitCroatia,5,Great place,I arrived to this hotel by incident unplanned. I managed to book the room trough the Crowne Plaza internet service using the chat with actual person. This provides me with savings over the regular price. Front desk personnel was very friendly and efficient. I was impressed with the layout of the hotel and the tranquility of the place despite its...
YYZAC,25-Aug-12,Toronto,5,Wow what a great modern property within the airport complex,Wife and I stayed here on a stopover this past August. Was at first puzzled by the heat when I stepped off the elevator on our floor before I soon realized that the entire hallway complex is open air with ponds and water features all the way to our room. Our suite was large and very modern with great touches...
Alex168,25-Aug-12,London United Kingdom,4,Great for an overnight stay,We stayed a the Crowne Plaza for an overnight stay and found it to be v good for an airport hotel. It was clean comfortable and well maintained. The concierge was helpful and helped me book an appointment with a hairdresser close to the airport as there isnt a good hair salon at the airport. We would not hesitate to...
Nyonya28,24-Aug-12,Palmerston North,4,Fantastic Airport Hotel,Spent a few hours here before our night flight and was pleased/amazed by the facilities and the convenience of this place. The hotel is in Terminal 3 itself and we easily went to the local food court in the basement and walked around the shops within the terminal.That night we wheeled our bags and took the skytrain again within...
Linda W,22-Aug-12,Brisbane Australia,5,Convenient and best Crowne Plaza,Turned out a great choice as flight was delayed in Sydney. Checked in after midnight. Even at that time of night and with quite a few late arrivals to check in the staff were very efficient and quick. As hotel was heavily booked got upgraded to a suite and it was huge.The bed was fantastic and despite being next door...

Dreamsong,20-Aug-12,Perth Australia,5,Great Transit Hotel,If you arrive late into Singapore or have a stopover then this hotel is a nice way to refresh after a long flight.The rooms are clean modern very spacious and well equipped. If you can afford to upgrade to Club Privileges it is well worth it if you enjoy an evening drink and/or a quiet breakfast.Pack your bathers!...
Jase W,20-Aug-12,Sydney Australia,5,A well earned break,This is a great hotel if you want to break the flight from Australia to Europe. The hotel is attached to the airport and is very modern and very clean. It is a great place to stay and a short twenty minute taxi into the heart of Singapore...definitely recommended.
zazzo67,19-Aug-12,Peschiera Borromeo Italy,4,Just for one night,If you have to wait your connection flight this your hotel! It is located inside the terminal. Clean with big rooms and big nice bathrooms. Very important in this kind of hotels: no noise from the airport. There is a nice pool. We tasted the chinese restaurant inside the hotel: not bad but expensive.
malakialj,17-Aug-12,Hawaii,3,Overpiced,While this airport is incredibly convenient and easy to find for those arriving into Singapore late at night or leaving early in the morning I found it to be ridiculously overpriced. I just completed two one-night stays here and if I hadnt had early flight would have gone back into the city for the second stay.The hotel is surprisingly...
Vanessa099,14-Aug-12,Brisbane Australia,5,Great for a stopover,Stayed for 1 night on a stop over from Australia. Easily accessible by sky train and located within terminal 3.

Would definately stay here again if on a stop over...
Blurgeshmurg,14-Aug-12,Toronto Canada,5,Spectacular and innovative. One of the best hotels Ive seen.,This is a truly gorgeous hotel - setting trends in hotel design not following them. The service was excellent and the room amenities were fantastic for a 4-star property.What truly makes it a great stay is the design. The outdoor pool area on the third floor is the hub and little waterways trail off from it all along the...
55234724surf,13-Aug-12,Singapore Singapore,5,Short but sweet visit,We had a layover in Singapore on the way to Bali. Came in late at night and needed to leave in the morning. Changi was expensive but in the airport so we went for it. The upgraded us to a suite and is was magnificent. Big enough to live in elegantly decorated well designed comfortable quiet. The only problem was...
Wheels76,13-Aug-12,Brisbane Australia,5,Crowne Plaza crowns them all!,Wheelchair accessible taxis are rare and clumsy things in Singapore so if you are like me and been on the $100 return hair raising ride the Crowne Plaza is a dream come true! Board the Sky Rail for a 2 minute ride from Changi Airport across the double highway right inside the Crowne Plaza Hotel! I had booked a disabled...

The rooms a light and functional. The bathroom has a shower and a tub. Even so close to the airport you dont hear it. Ive stayed for the 3rd time there and Ill return as soon as I...
Monty1424,11-Aug-12,Boulder,2,Convenient but mediocre hotel,As all say the location is great especially if one needs to catch an early morning flight. However the hotel is taking advantage of its location to overcharge for what is really a very mediocre hotel. Read on the hotel website about assistance with bags from and to the terminal but saw none available in the early evening when we...
Sasha122156,10-Aug-12,Rockville Maryland,5,excellent hotel,I stayed for less than 24 hours and highly recommend this place. Rooms are spacious clean and quiet. The bathroom is spacious and very good Internet worked flawlessly. Free water bottles. Breakfast was not great but acceptable. The check-in and check-out went quickly and smoothly. The business center helped me tremendously after the check-out (I had to make a reservation...
BorjesFamily,10-Aug-12,Singapore Singapore,5,Wish we could have stayed longer,We stayed in this hotel for a short visit which is a shame because it is a wonderful hotel. The rooms are very big along with the bathrooms. Great swimming pool and service. I would consider staying here in a heartbeat for a longer time next time.
Theminxter,09-Aug-12,null,5,Perfect stopover for mum with 2 kids flying long haul,I stopped over with my 2 kids under 4 on the way to the UK from Australia. It was the perfect place. The staff were very helpful and the facilities were great. When I asked for a doctor at 5 am for my sick daughter one was sourced for me immediately and billed to my room. I didnt have to...
Doctorjanet,09-Aug-12,null,5,A superb stay to lessen jetlag,Stayed for 24 hours to lessen jet lag from long haul flight. It worked. Lovely room. Quiet. Exceptionally clean and fresh. Had wonderful sleep. Dinner at the restaurant was not as good as expected. Think our order was forgotten then rushed. But still enjoyed our stay. Would do so again.
Aughust,08-Aug-12,Phillippines,4,Excellent Hotel,This is also one of my favorite hotels and has stayed here several times on leisure or just overnight on a connecting flight.I have stayed here as solo business couple family and I expect the same nice hotel.Having a status in Priority Club I always get a suite in CP Changi even on a paid or reward stay....
Gordon L,07-Aug-12,Port Moody Canada,4,An oasis of calm and luxury at the airport,Airport at the hotel: aside the obvious pros and cons of being away from the city centre the wonderful transit system and abundance of orderly taxis in Singapore might just negate those cons. This is a great hotel to stay at in Singapore an earns my recommendation especially if you are only going to be in town for a night...
orangecat01,07-Aug-12,Auckland,4,Good but overpriced,Very convenient.At the airport.Large comfortable bedNice large room but terribly over aircon with air flowing straight at your head while you are sleeping.Overpriced.Otherwise all mod cons.Be prepared to pay 7$SD for 500 ml bottle of water.I woke up dehydrated in the middle of the night and reached for a bottle of water in the fridge...
physicsmom04,06-Aug-12,Portland OR,5,A new favorite in Singapore,Stayed for a long layover - and wish Id booked this hotel for the earlier Singapore trips!Extremely comfortable hotel snuggled up to Terminal 3 at Changi airport but with all the amenities youd expect from any other Singapore 4-star hotel. Very comfortable bed in a well-soundproofed room. Bathroom was a luxury huge and well equipped with a deep soaking...
New2Langkawi2,04-Aug-12,Sydney Australia,4,Changi stopover hotel,I disembarked from Terminal 3 at Singapore Changi Airport. From the arrival gate I walked a relatively short distance to the hotel. My guess is the hotel is closest to Terminal 3. Its contemporary in design with use of natural light. I found the hotel quite dark in parts and devoid of light but was told it was by design...
Clive B,04-Aug-12,Ascot,5,Much more than just an airport hotel and well worth a stay,Located conveniently right on the airport and connected by excellent links to each terminal and the city by train or cab this is a great location for the transit passenger or someone not wishing to stay down town.I have been fortunate to stay in regular club and executive suites and have found all to be well appointed clean and...
PaavoTapani,03-Aug-12,Kuopio Finland,4,Very Good!,Had about 24 hrs between flights and decided to take it easy this time without going to the centre of Singapore at all. Great choice indeed: very friendly check-in and I guess there was an upgrade to the next category because the room was huge with great amenities. Moreover this hotel manages to deliver a resort feel when walking along...
Binman62,03-Aug-12,Binfield United Kingdom,2,Expensive and service and recognition have fallen sharply.,Crowne Plaza ChangingThis was my second visit  the last  being about two years ago. Things have changed and not for the better.It is still remarkably convenient for the airport. The rooms are spacious and clean the pool is great but United Airlines still run the APU on their 747 very early in the morning.However it is now...
Well_travelledmum_12,03-Aug-12,London,5,Much more than an airport hotel,Having been booked into this hotel by the insurance company due to its proximity to the airport I wasnt expecting much. However due to the staff attention to detail and comfort I had the perfect stay. Whilst I would not want to travel into the business district daily much preferring to be close to cut down travel time I would...
Chucky111,03-Aug-12,null,4,Pleasant surprise,I have lived in Singapore twice both my children were born here and I have visited numerous times. I know the city well so was very disappointed to be booked into an airport hotel by Singapore Airlines in a unplanned layover (typhoon delay in Taipei) rather than a hotel closer to town. But I have to say that the Crowne...
Andrew W,01-Aug-12,Warrington United Kingdom,5,Best Airport Hotel,Excellent one night stay at the Crowne Plaza Changi.Greeted upon arrival as an IHG priority club member.The room was spacious beautifully decorated in neutral tones and very well appointed.The location is perfect for transiting Singapore as it is directly connected to the airport.I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.
lovetotravelhk,31-Jul-12,null,3,Another run of the mill airport hotel,From the photos the hotel looks modern and new. However in real life it looks like whoever built it ran off in a hurry. The rooms design and workmanship are one of the worst Ive seen especially in the bathroom. The shower door can barely be opened because its blocked by the huge bathtub. The shower makes squeaky noises when...
DCM_Dublin,31-Jul-12,Dublin Ireland,5,Too good to be an airport hotel,This hotel is amazing. So clean modern & stylish. It even has an outdoor pool! The rooms are beautiful and very comfortable.

Jim P,30-Jul-12,Paris France,3,Ok airport hotel,This is by far the most convenient hotel when transiting through Singapore airport. However I found the hotel to be just ok. The corridors are outside in the tropical heat and we had two big thunderstorms to deal with when going to our room. Breakfast was very expensive for Singapore standards and dont ask for a special tea as they...
Bennyboyblue,30-Jul-12,London United Kingdom,4,Lacking charm but perfect for your needs,We stayed overnight on the way back to London after a side trip to Thailand.The hotel is right in the airport at Terminal 3 and easy to find. I booked online and got a double room for us and the two kids.We didnt eat in the restaurant as we had a look around the airport and ate in...
Leesa2009,29-Jul-12,Perth Australia,4,A great place to stay!,What a great way to start a holiday in Singapore! The hotel is beautiful and so easy to get to you can literally walk there. I would stay there again! The location of this hotel is very convenient It is a little expensive but for one night it is okay.
dimitri40,29-Jul-12,Brisbane,5,Great stopover coming back to Australia,My wife and I recently came back from Europe and we stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel which is connected to the airport via a walkway from Terminal 3 but you must clear customs to access it. Although we arrived at Terminal 1 It was no problem getting there by the very efficient Free mono-rail running every 2 minutes. The...
JKWD,25-Jul-12,Hong Kong China,3,Too expensive,The hotel is getting more and more expensive but the service and the faiclities have not caught up with the increase in price. The corridor to the room (which is semi-open) is hot and slippery. No free wi-fi is a big minus. The breakfast has little variety and very few Singaporean local delicacy.
euniceyew,24-Jul-12,malaysia,3,Convenient Hotel,The hotel has a very nice exterior and interior design in the building appearance but i wonder why they design the lobby to have such a dim light? to have more relaxing mood for the travellers?I was there for 1 night with my parents and my nephew.The hotel is at T3 and is very convenient for food choices as...
Spacca P,23-Jul-12,Montreal,5,Just one night but awesome,Had to sleep here for just one night due to a lost connection. I found this hotel so good and luxurious a landmark for every traveller who has to stop overnight in Changi.

CDinBKK,21-Jul-12,null,1,Convenient access to airport but poor service and value,I stayed here with four work colleagues for four nights. I was a convenient location as we were working at the airport.The food and beverage outlets have a limited range and are excessively expensive. The Chinese restaurant was awful with poor food and service- it felt like being in a Faulty Towers episode.Watch out for internet charges. Not...
papat,21-Jul-12,Gig Harbor Washington,3,Good for Transit,A transit is a transit and when you have to overnight near the hotel this is nice for closeness and food is fair but is a bit short on facility convenience and value. The rooms are nice but nothing dazzling the exterior hallways make this a unique hotel but dont add to the experience. The food was good in the...

Zoglets,12-Jul-12,Tokyo Japan,4,Convenient transit hotel,I stayed here for one night of business in Singapore. It is adjacent to Terminal 3. The design is modern but I do not enjoy walking outside from the elevator to the rooms. The room decor is nice and the room service is excellent. The bathroom amenities were good. The breakfast selection was very good with great selection. I could...
citybails,12-Jul-12,perth,5,Best Airport Hotel,We stayed in this hotel on route to Europe and would consider staying there again instead of taking the trip into central Singapore for a stop-over. You can go into the city via underground (metro) or jump in a taxi for a fraction of the cost of a taxi in Australia. We were given an upgrade to a suite which...
Elizabeth H,12-Jul-12,Brisbane Australia,3,Smart but overpriced poor service,We stayed in this hotel as an overnight stopover between flights. As others have said the big drawcard is that the hotel is inside the airport so no hassles with having to go through security customs immigration or taxis into town. It is very convenient for this purpose. It is also very smart with spacious and well-decorated rooms. We enjoyed...
REVENUEMANAGER,10-Jul-12,New delhi,5,PAR EXCELLENCE!!,A 5 minute walk to the hotel from the baggage Belt. You move out of the arrival gate and find a hotel staff member standing with your name card.

There are multiple dining options in...
bevmark,10-Jul-12,Sagamihara Japan,5,My favorite transit hotel,I love using this hotel for transit because it is connected to Terminal 3 and also the Airport MRT. But this hotel has so much more.

KerryGarry,10-Jul-12,Melbourne Australia,5,Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Hotel is perfect for stopover,We stayed one night at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Hotel and found it perfect for a short stopover in Singapore. You dont need to leave the airport to get to it (so dont need airport transfers etc) and they are very helpful. We arrived at 11.30pm and our next flight wasnt until 11.30pm the following night. They told us...

Jaeden2012,08-Jul-12,Manila Philippines,3,Convenient Location Only,Aside from the convenient location the Crowne Plaza is a relatively unimpressive hotel. It misses out on a lot of things such as in-room wi-fi and convenient outlets throughout the room. When I checked-in I requested a room near the elevator and was given one all the way at the end of the hallway. I wouldve understood if Id been...
minov,07-Jul-12,Shanghai China,5,Very convenient with comfortable rooms. Great design.,I have repeatedly stayed there now whenever I arrived late at Singapore airport or had to fly out early in the morning. Airport hotels can be terrible. This one is not. All rooms are design-wise convincing and well equipped. You can work in the room for a few hours as all rooms I had had a sufficiently large table and...
Lapidus,07-Jul-12,Australia,4,Good value for an overnight stay,I didnt find this hotel especially expensive (it is in Singapore after all) but I did find it very convenient and comfortable. I enjoyed the idiosynchratic design flourishes - you could have a competition to guess the number of different patterns making up the hotel spaces - and the comfort after a long flight. The staff were especially friendly and...
Macloo,06-Jul-12,Gainesville Florida,4,Expensive but very convenient,For $230 - $250 (U.S.$) per night (one person one room no breakfast) youll expect a really nice room -- and youll get it. Great shower and bathroom too. If you have a layover and your flights are on different airlines you CANNOT stay in the transit hotel thats inside Changi -- you have to go through immigration (very smooth...

Did not matter nice view and no disturbance from take-off / landing. Quite relaxing not to hav to rush into city when in transfer. We for some reason choose not to have breakfest at club lounge....
Ozwithkids99,06-Jul-12,Brisbane Australia,4,Very convenient and comfortable - a step up in airport accommodation,To avoid a bad transfer we overnighted at the Crowne on our way from Australia to the Maldives.Airport hotels are generally quite sterile and impersonal but the Crowne was pleasantly different from any we have used before.It is fantastically convenient - a short walk or shuttle train ride depending on which terminal you arrive at. Its entrance is...
Justin L,04-Jul-12,Portland Oregon,5,Excellent layover hotel,Traveling through SE Asia will eventually land you in Singapore at some point. When that happens stay at this Crowne Plaza... its excellent. Luxurious rooms with excellent soundproofing.

Trvlbdy,02-Jul-12,Oslo Norway,5,Luggage check-in service,Perfect for a stopover - excellent location at the airport. The service was great! The luggage can be checked in at the hotel reception so you dont have to stand in line at the airport!The fitness room was not well equiped but if you want to take a run it is fine. There were towels and water available in...
Seabird21,01-Jul-12,null,5,Surprisingly quiet,It may be pricey but in terms of convenience it was the best! I landed went through immigration and then straight through to the hotel lobby. Rooms were a decent size soundproofed perfectly and made for a really good nights sleep. The fact that we were already at the airport helped with the early morning start the next day. Didnt...
Nathan_MEL_78,01-Jul-12,Melbourne Australia,4,Impressive and the perfect solution to a late arrival and early departure the following morning.,We arrived into Singapore at 9pm with a 7am flight the next day.The staff were efficient without being rude. The room was of a quality that was much better than I expected and surpassed other 5 star locations weve stayed at on Sentosa.I also appreciated that the bell hop was not impressed upon us but Im sure if...
wurlycurly,30-Jun-12,London,2,Not great if youre a business traveller,Ive stayed here a few times when in Singapore for work and when other hotels down town have been full or very expensive. Its very convenient when arriving in from the airport as walkable from the terminals and and rooms and comfortable. On the downside there is nothing relaxing about over looking the runway and hearing planes take off all...
Gaylene S,30-Jun-12,Wellington,5,stopover,We had a one night stop over and arrived late after midnight. It was so handy to walk to hotel and to have a late check-out was so good.

nyah_mob,26-Jun-12,north west victoria,2,Not a good start to a holiday,After a good flight on singapore airlines we were surprised to not be met as we were supposed to after finding our own way to the hotel we entered up a gloomy ramp into a half light interior arriving at the reception area to find a person with our name board saying oh you are here your flight was early!!...
johnmc82,25-Jun-12,Port Orange Florida,4,Great for an Early Flight Out,Obviuosly a superior quality hotel that I didnt experience all of frankly as I flew in late nightand left early a.m. while transiting through the Singapore airport. Thats the great feature here though - this Crowne Plaza a short walk from the airport gates staying within the same structure and puts you 5 min. walk from the ticket counters in...
Patmum,24-Jun-12,Columbus MI,5,Excellent Airport hotel,Ive stayed here a total of 6 or 7 times now and every experience has been fantastic.The staff could not be more helpful the visual appearance of the hotel is great and the rooms are spotlessly clean.

Makaner,23-Jun-12,Singapore Singapore,4,Good airport hotel.,Very nice room - had one on the 8th floor overlooking the runway. Corridors to rooms were the verandah type exposed to the elements and it was a little hot during my stay walking to or from the room. In room dining was good. Nice dim sum restaurant on ground floor. Good housekeeping service.One disappointment was that they could...
EWR-NJ-traveler,21-Jun-12,Morristown New Jersey,5,Great airport hotel,Stayed here for 1 night while returning home. Hotel is large and seems to be more like a big city hotel. Directional signs were lacking in our arrival terminal but Information Desk directed us. We didnt see any signs to the lobby and it took us some time to find it on the first floor. Hotel corridors are open air...
Paul H,21-Jun-12,HKGSINCAN,3,Has the potential to be a really great hotel if they just ironed out a few kinks!,Booked a deluxe room for 1 night on a 5000 bonus points package rate (room only) which was US$5 more than the AP rate.

saskiacromwell,20-Jun-12,Melbourne Australia,4,Refreshing transit hotel,Having a transit hotel which allows you to engage with the outside world is very important.

andrew f,18-Jun-12,Perth Australia,2,$29 for six hours of wifi is an outdated rip off,had to spend 6 hours at this hotel due to flight delays all ammenities and staff are what you woud expect but quite frankly in this day and age wifi should be provided free and if charged at a more appropriate rate
DeeJay_9413,18-Jun-12,Wilmslow United Kingdom,5,Singapore Changi Trip,An excellent hotel with superb views out over the runway and apron at Changi offering good photo opportunities. The rooms were modern well designed and comfortable with an open plan feel.

Claire_Cooke,09-Jun-12,Dubai,5,Superb standard of airport accommodation,We stayed at the Crowne Plaza on a stopover but wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel has a the atmosphere of a serene spa with dark wood water features and greenery inside and out. The room was beautiful quiet and comfortable. We will definitely be returning!
numeros3,08-Jun-12,null,4,Very nice for an airport,This hotel is perfect for an overnight layover. Other than for business or layover theres no reason to stay here. The rooms are clean and modern. Expensive but worth it for a good nights sleep. However it is unfair and makes absolutely no sense that you have to pay more to be guaranteed a non-smoking room. Particularly in Singapore -...
ThrillingMe,07-Jun-12,Hong Kong China,4,One of the Best Airport Hotels,Im not keen on airport hotels. Even if they are run by major chains - almost always they are cheap nasty and functional at best. Its the transit demographic who are just too buggered to care... but the Crowne Plaza is an exception to the rule. IN fact we are going to go out on a limb here and declare...
carlos_yogya,07-Jun-12,Darwin Australia,4,Fell down in a few areas,Was an overall good experience though it did fall down in just a few areas. Pros are definitely the ease of access and. Check in was extremely fast. The money you pay for convenience is worth it especially if you factor in two cab rides plus transit to stay somewhere cheaper. Our room service meal the night we arrived was...
Kat0425,07-Jun-12,Raleigh North Carolina,5,Very comfortable hotel convenient to airport,I stayed at this hotel when I had a 14 hour layover. The location is very convenient (terminal three) if you have a short layover but need longer than the six hour block available at the airport transit hotel. I was able to get a reduced day rate by contacting the hotel directly. They charged 130 USD for check in...
stuartSydney,05-Jun-12,Sydney Australia,4,Great for an overnight,Very easy to reach the hotel from the airport. Beautiful modern rooms and helpful staff. Club food offerings not the best I have ever seen. Charging for wifi isnt great. Would use the hotel again if traveling through Singapore for sure. Great view of the runway. If you were a light sleeper you would hear the planes
SirElDoctore,05-Jun-12,London United Kingdom,4,Ambivalent,Briefest of stops for me arrived late flew early. Good and bad great sleep in comfy bad (which is the primary requirement hence four circles) but poor breakfast and the tacky sports bar was like a Michael Mann film from the 80s. Loud dated music oddly lit. The room was functional if unspectacular but you really wouldnt expect anything else....
mobogo,05-Jun-12,Sydney Australia,4,Above average airport hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip. The hotel looks new (probably is) and to reach it its a short walk from the departures area at Terminal 3 and right next to the Skytrain from Terminal 1. Staff are friendly and efficient as youd expect in Singapore food good bar good pool good. If I was to spend...
JenniferMary46,04-Jun-12,Bristol United Kingdom,5,Comfortable Stopover,We have stayed here on a couple of occasions and it is a really good place for a short stopover if you dont want the hustle and bustle of the city.

Prufreck,03-Jun-12,Hadlow United Kingdom,5,Excellent choice for a one night stay,We selected this hotel purely because of its location as a convenient overnight stay between two long haul flights. Check in was quick and efficient and the helpful receptionist suggested we pay SGD 70 for use of the club room which we did. This allowed us free wifi access tea/coffee at any time drinks and canapes in the evening and...
Robert H,03-Jun-12,Shepparton Australia,5,Superb hotel,We stay at a number of Crowne Plazas but this would have to be one of the best I have been to. Much better than most Airport Hotels and priced right.
welldone99,03-Jun-12,Sydney Australia,5,excellent hotel for a stopover on the way to Europe,we have stayed here before and use the hotel as it is so convenient. I booked and pre paid via the qantas website. Breakfast and 4pm check out included in the price. We had a speedy check in with no problems this time. I had emailed the hotel earlier to re confirm my booking and used my priority club #....
kyanna,02-Jun-12,queensland,5,Excellent!,We only stayed here 1 night in transit from Brisbane to Thailand. The reason we stayed here and not the transit hotel within the airport is because we were flying to Thailand from the Budget Terminal therefore had to go through Immigration and collect our luggage. We were only in Singapore for 12 hours and did not want to travel...
Daveyd01,02-Jun-12,null,4,Great location for transiting through Singapore,Stayed here just for a night as we transited to Phuket. The hotel was so easy to find and get to. Modern and funky.

Pandie,01-Jun-12,Auckland Region New Zealand,5,Perfect Location for Stopover,If you have to make an overnight stop in Singapore between flights there is no better place to stay than the Crowne Plaza. To be able to walk to the hotel and then back to the Terminal is fabulous. There is a short train ride required.The hotel is not the cheapest but when you take into account the proximity...
JHFIII,01-Jun-12,Folsom CA,4,Efficient layover in Asia,The location of the hotel is incredibly convenient. This combined with the very efficient Singapore immigration and ground crew cant be beat.Flying in on Singapore Air I made it from plane to room in under half an hour.If you need a layover stop Im Asia this is a good one albeit a bit pricey.
Jessica_nz2,31-May-12,Christchurch New Zealand,4,Comfortable rooms,Room was comfortable. Great airconditioning thankfully as it was hot hot hot outside. Could not hear much plane noise so got a great nights sleep. Staff friendly. Pool area nice.
Sawnbay,31-May-12,Sydney Australia,4,Great Stop,Stopped here overnight on my way to Europe. Fast/no fuss check-in. Beautiful room as always.Double glazing make the rooms very quiet and the little airport noise which does come through the entry door...cannot be heard from the bed making for a great nights sleep between long flights.
KohalaGal,31-May-12,Waimea Hawaii,5,Great hotel in the Singapore Changi Airport,From our arrival at Changi to the check in desk at the Crowne Plaza took less than half an hour - customs immigration and all. We arrived quite late in the evening nearly midnight and were given an upgrade to a junior suite. The room was extremely comfortable very spacious great beds very very quiet in spite of being right...
MCMember,29-May-12,South East England United Kingdom,4,Very Convenient,The Crowne Plaza is ideally located inside Terminal 3 literally next to the shuttle train stop making it easy to reach from all terminals. Ideal to rest between flights especially long haul ones or get some work done. Rooms are spacious and modern in style bordering on a design hotel. The various floors are arranged around a central patio meaning...
kiwibrent1968,26-May-12,Brisbane,5,Excellent location at Changi Airport,The Crowne Plaza hotel is an ideal hotel if you dont want the hassle of having to commute from the airport to your hotel. It is based in the centre of the airport. The airport itself is well worth checking out - the ground floor has a food court. Our room at the hotel was modern spacious clean and well...
ninkin21,24-May-12,Southport United Kingdom,4,great hotel but not for those on a tight budget!,me and my family stayed at this hotel on a stop over trip to Australia. It was perfect after our 13 hour flight from England it was a 3 min tram ride from the airport to the hotel front door exactly what we were looking for; a good nights sleep food and a shower. Our room was great very clean...
Travelyu,23-May-12,null,1,Bathroom Leak And EXTRA COST for internet,It is a good hotel if you dont need internet. or else you better prepare to pay extra for the interent and it is not cheap! I will not recommand for anyone for business trip. and very incovience too if you want to go to downtown
HappyTravel0504,23-May-12,null,4,Good choice for transit,I stayed there 1 night for transit. No doubt that it would be the best choice if you want to take rest before your next flight but dont want to travel all the way to city.I had a room facing the airport. I experienced noise whenever there was big jet like A380 nearby. I guess when they construct the...
DanielDP,23-May-12,Houston Texas,4,Great hotel if you need to stay on airport otherwise look elsewhere,I think this is a great airport hotel. Cannot get closer than this: you access it straight from the arrival hall.Price is not cheap but this is Singapore so all hotels will be fairly pricey. For that you get very good service good room and bed standard Crowne Plaza toiletries and accessories.One thing I found weird was there...

mdodd1985,21-May-12,Hedge End United Kingdom,1,A tale of two stays.,I stayed at this hotel twice. The first time was fantastic. The staff were nice and the room was fantastic. I actually thought I had found a haven in Singapore which for hotels can be quite difficult. I usually stay at the Shangri-La. As a result of the first stay I decided to return for a stay before my trip...
Chris C,21-May-12,Brisbane Australia,1,1 star attitude at 5 star prices,The Crowne Plaza has a Transit attitude to guests leaving me with the view that they didnt care because I was only overnight. The check-in experince was the worst Ive experienced anywhere - with five guests waiting two receptionists still took over half an hour to process our arrival. Then no sorry for the delay no welcome to the hotel...
Mark E,20-May-12,NSW,4,Great airport hotel,We were greeted with a smile plenty of privacy an amazing pool great buffet breakfast and a view that any plane spotter would love. It was great to walk around the different terminals and enjoy what is really a mini city. Will definitely make this hotel my stopover hotel from now on.
kevinyhli,18-May-12,Sydney Australia,2,New hotel poor maintenance,Stayed for one night at this property. Was looking forward to the stay as it is a relatively new hotels in Singapore.

LesS_10,18-May-12,Sydney Australia,5,A comfortable stopover,A planned 2 night stay to break up a long flight was money well spent. The hotel has large rooms with comfortable furnishings and all services. Being within the terminals makes it convenient for flights. The SMRT was quick and cheap to get around the city.This is an unqualified recommendation.
harrybBunbury,17-May-12,bunbury,4,Convenience in Singapore,Expensive But the convenience of a 5 minute walk to your accommodation after clearing customs far outweighs the costs.A left turn at arrivals and you are there.Rooms are large and cleantop class !
elbarto99,17-May-12,Canberra Australia,4,Awesome stop over hotel,Had one night here before catching our ferry out to Bintan Island. The room had a good view out onto the airport and because of my priority club gold status we have cookies and macaroons waiting in our room.Hotel is connected to the airport so you can get there in a few minutes from any of the terminals.
jws_7,15-May-12,Houston Texas,5,Very nice hotel and cool design,Very neat hotel to capture an outdoor tropical experience. Pool is very neat. There is a pull down shade in the bathroom that took a while to figure this out to prevent exposing others in the room when showering.
gntbt,15-May-12,Picton New Zealand,4,great breakfast and room,We were so glad to have chosen the crown plaza to stay as a break between our long flights from NZ to Vietnam.

asensiblechic,11-May-12,philippines,5,A Very Memorable Stay,We were not able to catch our connecting flight to our country due to the delay in our primary flight and our airline graciously booked us in this wonderful hotel. We took a tram from terminal 3 to terminal 2 to get to the hotel which is adjacent the terminal. We had a short wait at the reception so while...
Ellemay,10-May-12,Sydney Australia,4,Enjoyable short stay.,We were never intending to stay at the Crown Plaza Airport hotel however due to our Jetstar flight being delayed 4hrs we missed our connection to Malaysia.We decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza Airport Hotel due to its closeness to the terminals for our early morning flight.A Link bridge from terminal 3 connects the Crowne Plaza Changi...
TTJanes,07-May-12,Virginia,4,Great Layover Hotel; Top of the Crowne League,We stayed on an overnight layover between planes.

Great blinds good for daytime naps. Only slight negative was it...
scottydoesntkno,04-May-12,CA,5,This is a near perfect airport hotel,Ive stayed here about 7 times total and it is always clean quiet and convenient. The entrance is just outside terminal 3 and provides easy access to early morning flights. Its not cheap but the rooms are very well appointed flat screens and Bose stereos in all rooms. Lots of glass good views of the airport and almost no outside...
Ruuli,03-May-12,null,4,Convenient and comfortable. Overall a memorable stay!,Just an escalator away from the airport. The hotel was spotlessly clean the buffet spread was good and the room had tasteful woodwork. The receptionists were extremely helpful. Also there are shops and a food court just below the hotel.
Mi-Dan20,30-Apr-12,Dallas Texas,2,Location allows poor amenity extra fees & rooms not sound proof,We stayed here after our 2 week holiday due to the location and flight times at 2am. First off you can hear the planes the rooms are NOT sound proof as advertised. Every single hotel we stayed in during our travels to 4 different countries including the wonderful Pan Pacific Orchard in Singapore when we initially arrived for our holiday...

Treeee,27-Apr-12,Sydney Australia,4,Good transit stop whilst travelling,This is another great transit stop whilst travelling.Rooms were more than functional given a 20hour transit stop between flights. Not quite as clean as Id like (cleaners forgot a dirty rag in the bathroom).My only gripe would be the lack of wireless internet - surely for an airport hotel of such calibre as the Changi the hotel should...

JMFTravels,24-Apr-12,London,3,OK - it is an airport hotel after all,The context of this stay is that Singapore was absolutely full with a major Expo and all my favourite hotels were full.

A large and comfortable reception area full of sofas...

The hotel has a 5 star rating however when we checked in they downgraded the type of room we had paid for using the excuse they were heavily booked.

James N,23-Apr-12,Xiamen Fujian China,1,overpriced rip off internet poor customer service.,Hotel itself is ok. Easy location if you have to stay at the airport overnight. You can hear the planes come in and out but considering you are in between two runways its really quite quiet.For the price they charge its over the top.

Travelinpalladin,19-Apr-12,Houston Texas,3,High prices & complacency,This is not a bad airport hotel one in which I’ve stayed a few times when I have only a few hours between connections at Changi but need some shut eye and a shower.

h0d,18-Apr-12,London England,5,Its hard to get excited about airport hotels but this ones top of the class,In my experience airport hotels tend to rely on their location location location and have a slightly unloved feel to them. Changis Crowne Plaza bucks the trend with a sense of style to complement its superb location at Terminal 3 making an overnight stop between connecting flights a pleasure rather than a chore.

Philduck,30-Jan-12,Birmingham United Kingdom,4,Great hotel...but when is a Best Price Guarantee not a best price guarantee?,I have reviewed this hotel before.

msCharrie,27-Jan-12,Manila Philippines,4,Great Hotel - though a bit far,We stayed for 3 days in this lovely hotel.From the airport we had no problem locating the hotel because it is inside the airport itself.

TomX,27-Jan-12,Rochester New York,3,Location location location...but....,So two weeks in Singapore and Malaysia on business was going to end in Singapore the afternoon before a 6:00am flight to Tokyo.

ljkjp,22-Jan-12,Japan,3,Bad and Good,This hotel is attached to Changi airport. Unfortunately its only attached to Terminal 3 so you might need to push bags and trolleys around for a while if you arrive at any other terminal - not the hotels fault.Guests are mostly passengers in transit and airline crew between shifts.The room we had was OK but the hotel does...
MaliTaus,22-Jan-12,Tunis Tunisia,4,Stress Free,While a little pricey you virtually walk straight from your plane to your room. This and the fact you dont have to pay for a taxi mean this is super low stress accommodation which makes up for the price.The rooms are lovely modern and clean but relatively small.

Liam T,22-Jan-12,Melbourne Australia,4,Excellent Stopover Hotel,I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Changi while on a 12 hour layover and found the hotel to be excellent. It was quite expensive (I think I paid 330sgd for a basic room) but that because I left it too late and due to the time of the year.The hotel is extremely well located and you can enter directly...
simoncpitt,22-Jan-12,Brisbane Australia,4,The Airport Hotel,Connected to the airport (Terminal Three) and the MRT this hotel is ideal for a short stay. The modern design to the hotel with large rooms ensures this is not just another hotel stay. Ideal for a stop-over business trip or quick trip to the city.An extensive breakfast buffet starts your day.
JLdarwin,22-Jan-12,Darwin,5,From horrible flight to 5 star luxury in 10 mins,Why Crown Plaza at Changi Airport? The only international flights out of Darwin are operated by budget airlines. We flew Jetstar and had to transit in Singapore on the way to Penang. If you transit in Singapore Jetstar requires you to collect your bags and go through customs before catching the next flight. As I use a motorised wheelchair and...

bikoparrot,19-Jan-12,Calgary Ab,5,Fantastic hotel and a great option in Singapore,We were very pleased to arrive at the Crowne Plaza after a long fight from Sydney. After having looked at a lot of reviews and options in Singapore city itself and looking at the maps and easy transport into the city the idea of staying at an airport hotel even with a family of 5 looked quite appealing. The prices...

Chris R,15-Jan-12,Minneapolis Minnesota,4,great airport hotel,Very modern and nicely appointed hotel connected to terminal 3 of the airport. Can be a bit difficult to find until you get to terminal 3. Far more convenient than going into the city if you have an early flight! Nothing to do around there though - so it is really a transit hotel.
BouBali,15-Jan-12,Singapore,4,Hit and miss,The Crowne Plaza at Changi Airport has the potential to be so much more but someone somewhere - perhaps in management? - seems to have lost the plot of late.My two most recent reservations - one made by phone and the other in person (albeit during a period when the entire booking and billing system crashed on 11 January)...
bronjen,12-Jan-12,Noosa Australia,5,Convenient and classy,This is the most convenient hotel for travellers as the lobby is accessed from inside the airport and the metro system was also within the airport building. Our room was beautifully decorated and very spacious with a view over the pool and the control tower. It was spotlessly clean and decorated to a high spec. The staff were efficient and...

cherikizz,10-Jan-12,Quezon City Philippines,4,a hotel within the airport building itself,I read somewhere that you just have to literally push your luggage out of the airport to arrive at the doorway of this 5* hotel. I was surprised at how literal this was! After getting our luggage at baggage claim we literally just went down the corridor (still pushing our luggage carts) then there it was the hotels entrance and...

gemellor,31-Dec-11,Washington DC District of Columbia,3,Disappointing this Time,This is my 6th time staying here at the hotel. Unfortunately when I checked in they had no record of my having stayed here several times in the past four years. The woman at the front desk couldnt be bothered to track down my travel records. (While inconsequential to some its important for repeat guests to ensure that their previous...

jjy88sm,26-Dec-11,Singapore Singapore,4,Amazing Hotel but......,Amazing property situated smack dab in the middle of airport and within a stones throw from Terminal 3. Room was beautiful. Well appointed. Modern. Clean. Great shower. I would perhaps offer the following advice to the management.1) Your aircons are terrible. We all froze to death despite setting the temp to 25c.2) The odor or jet fuel permeates...
Richard H,23-Dec-11,Andover United Kingdom,4,Convenient Modern Hotel,We stayed one night breaking a long haul trip. Being on the airport (T3) we could take our cases via an airport trolley from the T1 baggage belt right to the hotel reception desk via the Skytrain terminal link. The MRT station is under the hotel which made a days excursion into the city an easy 45 min subway ride....

BerlindaSurrey,22-Dec-11,Surrey,4,Pleasant Hotel inside the Airport.,Very convient if your transfer is within 24 hours why waste time travelling into the city and back?The hotel is clean and quiet it provides all the services you would expect from a 4 star hotel.IA little pricey but so are all airport hotels?

Ryuko,03-Dec-11,San Francisco,4,Beautiful convenient and comfortable,Being built into Changi Airport it is incredibly convenient for those on short stays. Although the airport is some distance from the rest of the city this poses no problem as Singapore has a very robust mass transit system. A roughly 30-minute ride at about S$1.50 gets you downtown or a 15 minute cab ride at about S$14.00 so either...
steveck,02-Dec-11,Melbourne Australia,4,Convenient,have used the Crowne Plaza at Changi Airport Singapore a few times now and always relatively happy.

KOA002,09-Aug-11,Captain Cook Hawaii,5,The ultimate in convenience!,After flying in to Singapore numerous times and stepping outside of airport customs and getting transportation to a hotel downtown the heat and humidity just melts you even at 1 am in the morning and traveling for hours.

WilsonfromDubai,04-Aug-11,Dubai United Arab Emirates,5,Top of the charts for Favourite Airport Hotel,This has to be one of the more unique Crownes we have stayed. From its ridiculous proximity to the MRT (metro) and airport to the open-concept corridors leading to the rooms; from the maze like swim pools to the fantastic Chinese restaurant to the excellent service of its staff we cannot find anything bad to say about the Crowne Changi....

Geddes_7,11-Jun-11,Sydney,3,By airport standards - marginally better than average but comes at a price,Like all airport hotels you pay a premium for the proximity to the departure gate.The Crowne Plaza is very new and its decor is on the trendy side. There is nothing in the way of ambience about the location but it is close to the terminal. The trouble with trendy is that is looks good and isnt quite as...
rdabca,11-Jun-11,Red Deer Canada,5,More than I expected,Having stayed at many airport hotels I am used to having fairly low expectations and was really surprised at how nice this hotel is.

Location (almost) in terminal 3 at Changhi airport makes this most conveniently located hotel - ever.Could not fault the service rooms staff.

ozmadmax,27-Feb-11,Melbourne,3,Nice rooms crap service,Stayed here again recently. Check-in was unfriendly and could be likened to ordering a burger at a fast food joint on a freeway - no personality no recognition of status (Priority Club) nobody to carry luggage to the room. Room was nice but attention to detail might have meant the pubes in the shower werent mine! With no choice when...

Philipat,27-Dec-10,Bali Indonesia,1,24-Hour Airport?,My wife and I were very disappointed with this hotel. We flew in on an Emirates flight which arrived late so we checked-in at 3 am. We were then asked to check-out at 12 pm so paid a full rate (USD 200) for a 9 hour stay. This is not very reasonable for a hotel in an international airport that...

mos505,29-Nov-10,Biel,4,very good airport hotel,After experiencing so many drab or sterile airport hotels I find this Crowne Plaza refreshingly enjoyable as its open hallway design puts the (presumably transiting) guest in a tropical mood.The hotel is new and thus modern with comfortable and spacious rooms.

LeavingOrangeCounty,24-Nov-10,Laguna Beach California,1,Extemely Noisy - Caution/Beware!,Other reviewers must be deep sleepers because I dont get how they could rate this place so highly. Yes the rooms/facility is modern clean etc but ultimately its all about the quality of the sleep right?Stayed here for four nights and almost went crazy with the noise.

MelvinLin,28-Oct-10,Singapore Singapore,2,Disappointing. They probably live to over-promise under-deliver.,Stayed here for two nights in the suite that came with my wedding package. Was extremely disappointed with the event-support by the hotel and many of my guests had pretty negative feedback as well which is a story for another occasion. In essence even things that are stated in the agreement may not necessarily be delivered and they are not...
Rustica,28-Oct-10,Canberra,5,A wonderful airport hotel,We arrived very early in the morning on a flight from Paris and the staff bent over backwards to make our room ready for us.

arthursiew,12-Jul-10,San Francisco California,4,Convenient,I chose the Crowne Plaza because of one thing only the location. However the rooms in the picture looked pretty decent too.

RKrieger,09-Jul-10,Frankfurt,3,woken up by jet engine,I had only less than 12 hrs in Singapore and chose the Crowne Plaza for its location at the airport.

zydeco34,03-Jul-10,West Sussex United Kingdom,3,Best of the airport options,Its worth going through immigration to stay at this hotel as opposed to the in-terminal transit hotels. It is a perfect location and means no messing with the queue for a taxi. It is quiet even with take-off and landing aircraft happening next door. Its stylish and modern.

hooob,22-Jun-10,Toronto,3,Upscale and convenient hotel but incessant extra charges,This is an upscale hotel right at Changi Airport in Singapore. It is a quick walk to both terminals T2 and T3 and quick access to the MRT train downtown.

JLWUK,12-Jun-10,UK,5,FANTASTIC AIRPORT HOTEL,Although this is an airport hotel it certainly didnt feel like it. It was more in keeping with a 5 star luxury city hotel with its elegant and sleek furnishings. We stayed in a club room which opened out onto the beautiful and unusual pool area.

Globaladventure,01-Jun-10,London United Kingdom,4,Good airport hotel,Airport hotels are not somewhere you normally choose to be - they are more of a necessity. The Crowne Plaza is in an excellent location attached to Terminal 3 (so no transfer bus to wait hours for). The rooms are well designed - one feature i did like was the sofa at the end of the bed directly opposite the...

kenwade,05-Apr-10,Peterborough,4,top quality,For an overnight stay or perhaps even longer this has to be one of the best hotels in Singapore for the money. We paid around $200 singapore which included a breakfast. A great room with very little aircraft noise was worth ther money alone the breakfast was a bonus. Its so easy to get into the city too we only...
kaw118,30-Mar-10,lincs UK,5,As an airport hotel - it cant be beaten,Arriving late at night this hotel is in an ideal position; sky train from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3 although the entrance is a bit dark at that time of night!

vacationtime2000,03-Mar-10,New York,4,Stylish airport hotel minutes from Changi lobby,We stayed here due to an unexpected layover. The hotel is actually very hip and modern looking. Of the 4-5 star hotels in Singapore - this airport hotel is actually more boutique stylish than most of them. The hotel has a metropolitan boutique hotel feel to it - too bad its by the airport we would have stayed here if...

gordy123,26-Feb-10,London,5,Great Hotel-,I recently stayed at the Crowne with my wife and one year old. I heartily recommend staying here if you are transferring through Singapore simply because of its closeness to Changi Airport. The rooms were immaculate and prepared in advance with our cot-bed.

bobandscilla,21-Feb-10,wales UK,3,Very convenient but hard bed!,We stayed one night to break the journey to NZ. Chose the hotel for its accessibility to the airport and MRT and it was very convenient. The room was large and very well appointed as was the bathroom. Our only complaint was the bed which was extremely hard and so difficult to get comfortable.

We...
jen8888,13-Feb-10,Lake Macquarie Australia,5,Will always stay at this hotel,I dont agree with the reviewer complaining about decore and design of this hotel nor about the noise problem.

Timo R,07-Feb-10,Helsinki Finland,5,One of the best hotels in Singapore,I have stayed in Crowne Plaza twice now and I’m a bit puzzled by the review on Tripadvisor complaining about the airport noise. First time I could not hear a hiss in my room. This time I probably heard one plain taking off. My door was facing the runway so obviously the doors are the weakest point. It the reviews...
ozden,05-Feb-10,kemer,5,Pleasant Stopover,We stayed in Crowne Plaza at Changi Airport for a night on our way from Auckland to Bali in Jan 2010. Crowne Plaza Changi is an excellent airport hotel with spacious and modern comfortable rooms. We stayed at a room not overlooking the tarmac and did not have any problems with noise whatsoever. The hotel is easy Access from terminal...
LezGoLezGo,05-Feb-10,Hereford UK,4,Good Location Ridiculously expensive Drinks,Apart from the absolutely rip off prices for the mini bar I have nothing negative to say about this hotel.Obviously as it is above the airport buildings it is well situated for accommodating air travelers and if you are a plane spotter you get a perfect view of the runways and planes landing and taking off.I did not...

TravelerVA51,30-Jan-10,Potomac Falls VA,4,Perfect for a late night arrival at Changi,Traveling from the east coast of the USA on United means arriving in Singapore past midnight.

Room was very nice and spcious and I was upgreaded to a suite. Everything about the room was great aside from the fact I could hear everyplane taking off (my room faced the run way).So if you are noise sensitive then you may...
ScrappinPom,28-Jan-10,Western Australia,4,Generally good noise is a problem though,In general I didnt really have any big problems with this hotel and it was fit for purpose. I was travelling alone with my six year old and so did not want to go into town overnight as we had an early flight the next day. It made sense to stay near the airport. However if I was with my...
40ishcouple,27-Jan-10,Brisbane Australia,4,not your average Crowne Plaza,It seemed a no brainer to book this hotel for a 16 hours lay-over. It was a real treat to enter the lovely room only minutes from leaving customs and not have to endure yet another queue for a cab.The hotel and its rooms are very stylish with all the latest mod cons. Some might find them a tad...
Ceadmill,19-Jan-10,Australia,5,Outstanding,The room was fab it had everything charger for ipod iron ironing board hairdryer flat screen tv great storage etc. Even though we where staying in the airpot the noise level was almost non existent.

oldchemprof,18-Jan-10,nj,5,Great airport hotel,Couldnt be more convenient - attached to terminal no shuttle hassle. And - attractive rooms fascinating view and despite airport location quiet. Beautiful landscaped pool area with view of nearby control tower - an interesting contrast. Many food choices in the airport at reasonable prices. Only downside - I found the mattress somewhat too hard.
cdv1,17-Jan-10,Sydney,5,Would not stay anywhere else love the Crowne Plaza,We had two stop overs on way to Europe and back after long flights early morning and late night arrivals rooms were always ready just a pleasure to walk into the lobby and know you are staying here we paid a little extra for the club lounge and had a midnight flight the next day the hotel allowed us to...
loulang,15-Jan-10,Nt,4,breathtaking,Its very convenient to have a hotel inside the airport. The staff are very friendly and the room was breathtaking. They thought of everything including being able to watch and hear the TV while in the tub and a very long bench for putting the luggage on. The only thing I didnt like was the cold water of the pool...
LizaC-Medlar,15-Jan-10,Southern England,3,Trendy modern hotel very convenient for airport,Stayed here for a one-night stopover between flights. Very handy for the airport as you can wheel your trolley directly from the airport into the hotel. Found the hotel layout rather rambling and confusing and the rooms somewhat over-trendy - the necessary air-conditioning resulted in a very cold blast alongside the bed.The food in the Azur Restaurant was reasonably...
leatours,13-Jan-10,Surfers Paradise Australia,5,Changi Surprise,This Hotel was unexpectedly good equivalent to many 5 star Hotels located in far more exotic locations than linked to an airport terminal at the world’s busiest airport. But then Changi Airport Terminal 3 is no ordinary building it is Singapore’s newest and greenest addition to this huge people processing facility. This terminal is home to Singapore Airlines new A380...
Swimmy128,12-Jan-10,Mill Creek Washington,3,Very clean but service is lacking,This is a very modern hotel with a great swimming pool. The location is also good if you have an early morning or late arriving flight. The problem with this hotel is that they charge for everything and the service is spotty. We stayed at this hotel for a business trip for 12 nights and then again for 6 nights....
onebadhatharry1,08-Jan-10,Hertfordshire,4,Stop Over Hotel of the Highest Quality,Now I must start my review by saying that I was only here for one night owing to an early flight in the morning.

Peter D,07-Jan-10,Manchester England,4,Ideal Stop Over Hotel,Stayed at this hotel on our way over to Sydney. The idea was to land get straight into a clean bed eat and then get the ongoing flight. It didnt dissapoint on any of these points. Check in was slick despite us arriving at 6:30am. We were in a lovely large clean bedroom within 20 mins of landing. The room...
IndyES,01-Jan-10,Madrid Spain,5,Excellent Airport Hotel,We stayed 1 night while transiting from Europe to Darwin. Our room (King Bed Deluxe) was very modern clean spacious excellent equipped and very comfortable.The only negative point was that my Priority Club status was not recognized when I asked for an extended check-out. Despite this it is definitely a great accommodation and we would stay there again.
simonSussex,31-Dec-09,sussex,5,Fantastic hotel,Yes all the rave reviews are true the Crowne Plaza is a very modern stylish hotel.

Joe_Fong,26-Dec-09,Singapore Singapore,4,We enjoyed the stay,I am a Singaporean looking for a short holiday away from home and this time round we decided to stay within the country in a relatively new hotel and Crowne Plaza fits the bill.

georgieasnick,20-Dec-09,San Francisco California,4,For an airport hotel it is fab.,Check in was very fast as was check out. The hotel as preiously noted is ultra-modern but appropriately stylish and not overly designed. Very busy for obvious reasons (the airport).

sweet_mermaid,12-Dec-09,Asia,3,Quite Disappointed,This hotel is only convenient if you are planning to depart from Terminal 3 of Changi Airport if not I see no reason to stay here at all. If your flight is in the wee hours of 4am there is no sky train to take you to terminal 1 or 2. The airport shuttle is so infrequent its best not...
nimy,11-Dec-09,bangkok,2,The room is really nice but staffs are terrible,Well the room itself is pretty nice; guess its supposed to be 4 or 5 stars with this price. However the bed was really hard as it felt like a 3 stars hotel! After staying in a nice hotel with a nice bed at other fancy hotels; this is a ripped off.Check in staff made me feel extremely unwelcome...
drsgbaker,04-Dec-09,london,3,convenient to airport but only if your flight arrives after the 2pm check in time,We arrived at the reception desk at 9.00am after a long haul overnight flight desperate for a shower and a bed only to be greeted with the news that the Crowne Plaza has a check in time of 2pm. When we pointed out that it was an airport hotel and asked why we couldnt be accommodated earlier we were told...
Lotse,02-Dec-09,North Wales UK,3,Good location pricey,Being based in the airport its very handy. Its public decor is very dark and the passageways to the rooms very dimly lit. The room was very modern clean and the shower simply divine after a week of damp squib efforts in other hotels.Arrived 45 minutes before the restaurant closed to find them virtually set up for breakfast. So...
IntlSalesGuy,01-Dec-09,Phoenix Arizona,5,Unbeatable Convenience and Modern Amenities,Stayed here for 2 separate nights while transiting through SE Asia.

squirrel2203,25-Nov-09,Chelmsford United Kingdom,4,Really good for an airport hotel.,When you compare this with airport hotels elsewhere its stand-out good.

Very modern and large with a fairly big bathroom with a separate shower and a deep bath....
tmlemberg,24-Nov-09,Stockbridge,5,WOW!,Stay here. The room we stayed in was wonderful and the staff were the best people that we meet in Singapore. We stayed here after a cruise and the staff was as wonderful as the people on the boat we sailed on. The only issue that we had was that the hotel was so far from the Singapore Zoo that...
FrequentFrier,24-Nov-09,Sydney Australia,1,Beware!,I stayed for one night between flights to and from Singapore but would choose elsewhere next time. The hotel is conveniently attached to the airport terminals - although you need to go through customs and immigration to reach it. The dark decor of the hotel is rather off-putting. The hotel corridors are exposed to the air - hot and humid....
JackNicklaus,24-Nov-09,UK,5,Very good airport stay,Stayed here for one night in October 2009. Couldnt be more convenient for the airport. Very efficient modern and clean. Reception very helful in finding a room before normal check-in time becasue of our early arrival. Too far out of centre for a longer stay but would definitely stay here again when overnighting in Singapore.
peripatetic_aust,19-Nov-09,Australia,4,A new idea in aiport accom,On balance I was happy with CP and would stay again. However pricing policy is a worry as they are pushing the envelope.

Its also very quiet for such a busy location. Being handy to Changis multitude of food outlets is also a real positive. And travelling into Singapore is very easy using their great train system. Definitely stay here if...
mdns,26-Oct-09,Madison Wisconsin,4,Nice room-y room!,Conveniently located at the airport. Great amenities comfortable bed and bathroom. But definitely too pricey if youre staying for just a transit (less than 12 hours) it charges the typical Singapore accommodation rate its a dollar amount through the roof for what you get.
DanAirUK,25-Oct-09,London England,5,Excellent hotel dispite the wacky design,We wanted to stay near the airport as we had an early flight and the hotel could not have been more convenient - just a 5 minute walk to check-in for our flight.

FreqTraveller09,22-Oct-09,Perth,5,I WILL BE COMING BACK TO THIS HOTEL !!! EXCELLENT !!!,As a solo traveller I found the Crown Plaza at Changi Airport the easiest place to find.

My check-in wasnt until 3pm but...
